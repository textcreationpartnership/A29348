            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He precedent Pſalm contain a mournful complaint to the Lord powred out in a way of prayer. This (eſpecially the former part of it) is a pleaſant Song of praiſe.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of it, is the Lord.</p>
            <p>The things which he mentions as moſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42649:9"/> ſweetly refreſhing his own ſoul, and moſt eminently conſpicuous in the Lord towards his people, are his mercy, faithfulneſs and power.</p>
            <p>Firſt, His mercy, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>I will ſing of the mercies of the Lord for ever.</hi> So <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. I <hi>have ſaid mercy ſhall be built up for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, His faithfulneſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulneſſe to all Generations;</hi> verſ. 2. <hi>Thy faithfulneſſe ſhalt thou eſtabliſh in the very Heavens;</hi> both ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in his Covenant which he made with <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed; <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>I have made a Covenant with my choſen, I have ſworn unto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid my ſervant; thy ſeed will I eſtabliſh for ever, and build up thy Throne to all Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, His power, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Who in the Heaven can be compared to the Lord? who among the ſons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?</hi> verſ. 8. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, who is a strong Lord like unto thee?</hi> manifeſted by his works of</p>
            <p>Firſt, Creation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>The Heavens are thine, the earth alſo is thine; as for the world, and the fullneſſe thereof, thou haſt founded them; Verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>The North and the South, thou haſt created them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Providence, verſ. 9. <hi>Thou ruleſt the raging of the Sea, when the waves thereof ariſe thou ſtilleſt them,</hi> ſhewed</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42649:9"/>
            <p>Partly towards his enemies in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, verſ. 10. <hi>Thou haſt broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is ſlain; thou haſt ſcattered thine enemies with thy ſtrong arme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Partly, Towards his people in their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, verſ. 16, 17, 18. <hi>In thy name ſhall they rejoyce all the day, and in thy righteouſneſſe ſhall they be exalted; for thou art the glory of their ſtrength, and in thy favour our Horn ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted: for the Lord is our defence, and the holy One of Iſrael is our King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt having ſpoken largely of the power of God, returns to that with which his heart was moſt affected, <hi>The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Covenant of God</hi> made with <hi>David,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. and ſhews at large the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of it, what great things God would do for him, and how great and mighty he would make him: and for a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith in this great promiſe of God, the Pſalmiſt declares</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Original of <hi>Davids</hi> power and authority, <hi>viz:</hi> that it was from God, from Heaven: he was no Uſurper, nor Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder, neither of mans, nor his own, but of Gods exalting, for ſo God ſaith, <hi>I have exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one choſen out of the people, I have found Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid my ſervant, with my holy Oyle have I anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Yet have</hi> I <hi>ſet my King upon my holy Hill of Sion. Peter</hi> and the other
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42649:10"/> Apoſtles ſpeaking of Jeſus before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſaid, <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord challengeth a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in <hi>David</hi> above all the Kings of the earth, calling him his King, <hi>My King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lords diſcovery of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did it; And to whom? <hi>Not unto the Princes of this world, but unto his holy One Samuel, who anointed David in the midſt of his brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.1, 3, 13. By ſome the word is tranſlated in the Plural Number, <hi>Sanctis tuis,</hi> to thy holy Ones, to wit, the Prophets, <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> one of which anointed <hi>David,</hi> and the other fore-told of the perpetuity of his Kingdome, 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 7.12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Yea, the Lord ſpake the ſame thing to his holy One <hi>David</hi> by the mouth of his ſervant <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 7.17. <hi>According to all theſe words, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all this viſion, ſo did Nathan ſpeak unto David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the diſcovery of it, we may</p>
            <p>Firſt, Obſerve;
<q>That it hath been Gods way of old, when he hath had any great, and remarkable thing to do for, or upon a people, to reveal it unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42649:10"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7. <hi>Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his ſecret unto his ſervants the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly</p>
            <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>That the diſcovery of Gods exaltation of Chriſt, his True, and Great Holy One, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and ſeperated above his fellows, was firſt made to his Holy Ones.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The manner of diſcovery thereof, and that was by viſion, God in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners ſpake in times paſt unto the Fathers, ſometimes, but rarely by Oracle, it being a wonderfull condeſcention on Gods part, and more than ordinary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the perſon to whom he ſo ſpake; this honour God put upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> as he told <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam, With him will I ſpeak mouth to mouth,</hi> Numb. 12.8. Sometimes, and more commonly, In viſions, and in dreams, <hi>Numb:</hi> 12.6. It was in viſion God ſpake to his Holy One, when he made diſcovery of his Grace; <hi>Then thou ſpakeſt in viſion to thy Holy One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are two things chiefly to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The mercy provided, and that is a King; not a mean, weak one, unfit for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42649:11"/> Throne, but a <hi>Mighty One, I have laid help upon One that is Mighty:</hi> if it be askt, Who is this King? the 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> is in anſwer, <hi>I have found David my ſervant, with my holy Oyle have I anointed him.</hi> Of him the Lord hath ſpoken, ſaying, <hi>By the hand of my ſervant Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I will ſave my people Iſrael out of the hand of the Philiſtims, and out of the hand of all their enemies,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.18. It is both <hi>David</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and Chriſt the ſon of <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, who was alſo <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, of whom <hi>David,</hi> eſpecially in his Kingly Office was a Type and Shaddow, who is alſo called <hi>David, Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> propheſying of the Kingdome of Chriſt, a long time after <hi>David</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> was fallen aſleep (having ſerved his Generation according to the will of God) ſaith, <hi>I will ſet up one ſhepherd over them, even my ſervant David, I the Lord will be their God, &amp; my ſervant David a Prince among them,</hi> Ezek. 34.23, 24. Again, <hi>David my ſervant ſhall be King over them; my ſervant David ſhall be the Prince for ever,</hi> Ezek. 37.24, 25. This is that <hi>David</hi> that liveth for ever, the Lord Chriſt that <hi>Mighty One,</hi> mightier, and higher than all others, as the Lord hath promiſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Alſo, I will make him my firſt-born, higher than the Kings of the earth;</hi> which words agree exactly to the Lord Chriſt, who is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42649:11"/> ſaid to be <hi>The firſt-born of every creature, the Beginning, the firſt-born from the dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence,</hi> Col. 1.15, 18. And by <hi>John,</hi> to be <hi>The firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, Rev:</hi> 1.5. And this is he that the Pſalmiſt principally ſings of, as he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in other Pſalms, who is, and ſhall be ſo great a bleſſing to Gods people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The people who partake of this mercy, over whom this King, this <hi>Mighty One</hi> was ſet, that he might help them, are not all the people of the world, not his foes, ſuch as hate him; not the proud and mighty ones of the earth, who deſpiſe and oppoſe him (though he be Lord over them alſo) but they are Gods people; one Tranſlation addeth, <hi>I have put help upon a Mighty One for my people.</hi> They are Gods people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the weakeſt and ſmalleſt of all people, not onely <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh, but alſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the ſpirit, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.32, 33. Who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their weakneſſe, and ſmallneſſe, the craftineſs, mightineſs, and multitudes of their enemies, ſtand in as much need of the Lord of Chriſt, the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> (That <hi>Mighty One</hi>) to help and ſave them, as ever <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh did of <hi>David</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> (That <hi>Mighty One</hi>) to deliver them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42649:12"/> from their Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have laid,</hi> or <hi>put help upon One that is Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, A Champion, one ſtrong, and able to help my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words may be conſidered</p>
            <p>Firſt, Generally and largely, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the care, and goodneſs of God in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to his people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Specially and ſtrictly, as they point out the particular thing wherein God is ſo good to his people.</p>
            <p>From the General and large Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words</p>
            <p>Obſerve;
<q>That the condition of the people of God in this life, is ſuch as they ſtand in need of help.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though this be not expreſſed in words, yet it is neceſſarily implyed; for help ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth need, and we are ſure that the Lord the moſt wiſe Agent, doth nothing in vain, he doth not ſend help to them that need it not.</p>
            <p>For demonſtration of which (ſeeing I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to inſiſt long upon it) I ſhall only mention</p>
            <p>Firſt, The many and mighty Perſecutors under whom they have lived (who have been ſtronger than they) the four great worldly Monarchies, <hi>viz: Babylonian, Perſian,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42649:12"/> Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> ſet forth by the four terrible Beaſts mentioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. whoſe natures are to tear and devoure: of which the laſt (under whoſe power yet they are) is moſt dreadfull, and exceeding ſtrong: whereupon they ever did, and (being not yet delivered out of the hands of all the mighty Ones that hate them) do ſtill want the help of ſome other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſore bondage and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion whieh their enemies have, and do keep them in (for the ſeed of the Serpent eſpecially being prevalent, cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the ſeed of the woman) by reaſon of which they have in their ſeveral Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſighed, groaned, and howled (as they do alſo to this very day in the Nations of the world, do plainly ſhew that they have, and ſtill ſtand in need of a ſtronger arm than their own to deliver them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The ſtrong cryes, and earneſt prayers heretofore, and now alſo put up to the Lord for help (which elſe were to no purpoſe, except to mock the Almighty) do ſpeak aloud the truth of this Aſſertion; <hi>That their condition is ſuch, as they ſtand in need of help.</hi> And it is not the worſe, but the better for the people of God, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is thus; for though it be a manifeſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42649:13"/> evidence and demonſtration of their own weakneſs, and ſelf-inſufficiency; yet the great goodneſs and deep w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſdom of God is in it, thereby with-holding occaſion from them of truſting, and glorying in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (an evil which they are exceedingly prone to) and as it were neceſſitating them (of whom otherwiſe he ſhould too ſeldome hear) to a daily recourſe to, and continual dependance upon himſelfe for help in every time of need; by means of which they are ſafely preſerved, and their Heavenly Father is daily glorified.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Obſerve;
<q>The Lord himſelf doth provide help for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their ſeverall conditions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have laid help,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not leave them without help in trouble (as the gods of the Heathen do thoſe that ſerve them) neither doth he leave it to others who are unable and cannot, or unfaithful and will not do it; but that they may not be failed in any time of need (they being a peculiar treaſure unto him above all people) he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes it himſelf for them (though he doth oftentimes make the meaneſt and weakeſt creatures an help to them,) ſo that they may truly ſay, <hi>Our help cometh from the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42649:13"/> Lord which made Heaven and Earth.</hi> And this is the great priviledge and advantage which the people of God have above others, that they are the people whom the Lord careth for, according to that of <hi>Jacob, Deut.</hi> 33. <hi>ult. Happy art thou O Iſrael, who is like unto thee O people ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help, and who is the ſword of thy excellency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Obſerve;
<q>The Lord doth lay in a ſufficiency of help for his people in their various conditions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What God doth, he doth to purpoſe; he diſpenceth full mercies and bleſſings to his people. <hi>I have laid help upon One that is Mighty.</hi> The Lord layes in a ſufficiency of help for ſervice, as alſo to ſave and deliver out of trouble.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he layes help upon Angels, thoſe <hi>Mighty Ones,</hi> who excell in ſtrength, for his people, as he did in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, he ſent an Angel who ſmote in one night 185000 in the Camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians, Iſa.</hi> 37.36. He ſent an Angel to the help of the three children in the exceeding hot fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, who did ſufficiently help, <hi>For the fire had no power upon their bodyes, nor was an hair of their head ſinged, neither were their Coats chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor the ſmell of fire had paſſed on them,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42649:14"/> Dan.</hi> 3.27. And alſo to <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was in the Lyons Den, who did help effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, for he was taken up out of the Den, <hi>and no manner of hurt was found upon him, Dan.</hi> 6.23. And likewiſe to <hi>Peter</hi> in Priſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.7, 10.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he layes help upon men, who of weak, he makes mighty to help; he made <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> mighty ones, and ſent them to the help of his people, he made <hi>Gideon</hi> a mighty man of valour, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Go in this thy might, and thou ſhalt ſave Iſrael from the hand of the Midianites;</hi> he made <hi>Ehud</hi> a man left-handed, as alſo <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> a woman, mighty for the help and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his people. (<hi>Jude</hi> 3.4.)</p>
            <p>Sometimes he layes help upon other Creatures, as upon the Stars, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.20. The Stars in their courſes fought againſt <hi>Siſera;</hi> upon Hail-ſtones, for with them the Lord holpe <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt the five Kings of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and it was help ſufficient, for they were more which dyed with hail-ſtones, then they whom the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſlew. (<hi>Jude</hi> 10.11.)</p>
            <p>Reaſons why the Lord doth lay in a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of help for his people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. From that All-ſufficiency, and perfection of power which is in the Lord; every thing as it is in Eſſence and Being, ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42649:14"/> it is in act and operation; and according to this Maxim, the Pſalmiſt ſings of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.5. <hi>Great is our Lord, and of great power.</hi> As alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.10. <hi>Thou art great, and doſt wondrous things;</hi> ſo that the Lord being Allmighty, and All-ſufficient in himſelf; for him to lay in a ſufficiency of help for his people, is but to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. From that height of affection which is in the Lord towards his people, they being his peculiar treaſure above all people, his ſons and daughters, the people of his love; this <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions as the cauſe of that ſufficiency of help which the Lord afforded to them in <hi>Egypt, Deut.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord loved you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you out of the houſe of Bond-men, from the hand of Pharoah King of Egypt.</hi> This is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3.9. as the reaſon of the great things God will do for <hi>Iſrael. —I have loved thee with an everlaſting love. —For I am a Father to Iſrael, and Ephraim is my firſt-born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. From his exceeding tenderneſs of his own Name, leſt that ſhould ſuffer, upon this account the Lord oft ſpared his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.9.14.22.44. <hi>I wrought for my Names ſake, that it ſhould not be polluted before the Heathen.</hi> So God will help ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42649:15"/> fot his Name ſake, leſt the enemy (who is alwayes ready to blaſpheme) ſhould reproach him, and either ſay, God would not help his people according to their need, and ſo the glory of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be ſomewhat darkned; or elſe he could not, and ſo the glory of his power ſhould be eclipſed; with this Argument <hi>Moſes</hi> pleaded with God to help and ſave his people, <hi>Numb:</hi> 14.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.26, 27, 28.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add no more to the confirmation of that which the Saints of the moſt High have ſo much experienced in their ſeverall Generations. And leave alſo the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all to Gods faithful Ones in their various conditions; and haſten unto a more ſtrict and particular conſideration of the words, which will afford theſe two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations;</p>
            <p>Firſt, <q>That Chriſt Jeſus is a Mighty One.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <q>That the Lord hath appointed this Mighty One to be for an help to his people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus is a Mighty One.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42649:15"/>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt ſinging of him, ſaith, <hi>Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O moſt Mighty,</hi> Pſal. 45, 3. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> prophecying of him, ſaith, <hi>His Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Councellour, The Mighty God,</hi> Iſaiah 9.6. The Angel decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother what manner of Son he ſhould be, ſaith, <hi>He ſhall be great, and called the Son of the Higheſt, and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the Throne of his father David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.32. <hi>John</hi> alſo teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him according to the Revelation of him which God gave unto him, calleth him <hi>Allmighty, Rev:</hi> 1.8. I ſhall forbear to add more particular places, the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures both of the Old, and New Teſtament, being a large proof of this thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mighty,</hi> is a word of large Extent, and of various Acceptation. Sometimes it is taken Generally, for any eminent, excellent One, that is greater than others; ſo it is uſed <hi>Gen:</hi> 10.8. where it is ſaid of <hi>Nimrod, He began to be a Mighty One in the earth, i. e.</hi> One great, and famous, excelling others; and in this ſenſe Chriſt is a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> greater than others, <hi>In all things having the preheminence;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and as ſhall be ſhewed at large.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is taken particularly, and ſpecially.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42649:16"/>
            <p>Firſt, For one that is rich and wealthy; thus it is uſed <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.1. where it is ſaid, <hi>Naomi had a kinſman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth.</hi> Alſo 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.20. The rich man is uſually called <hi>mighty:</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Chriſt is a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> he is a rich, wealthy One, and that both in reſpect of</p>
            <p n="1">1. Spiritual and Heavenly things, he is ſo rich, <hi>That in him dwelleth all the fullneſſe of the God-head bodily.</hi> He hath more of the Spirit than others, being full of all grace, wiſdome, and knowledge; yea, full of Unſearchable Riches, according to that of <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. <hi>That I ſhould preach among the Gentiles, the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. All other things, for he is <hi>heir of all things, Heb.</hi> 1.2. All corn, wine, wool, and flax, all the beaſts of the Forreſt, and the Cattel upon a thouſand hils, all the Fowls of the mountains, and every thing that moveth in the waters, are his; <hi>yea, the earth is his, and the fullneſſe thereof, the round world, and all that dwell therein,</hi> Pſal. 24.1. See what an inheritance his father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For one that hath power and ſtrength: ſtrong men are mighty men; and in this ſenſe Chriſt is a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> being full of power and ſtrength. The Apoſtle
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42649:16"/> ſpeaking of him, ſaith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Chriſt, the power of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, For one that is exceeding va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, that doth moſt vigorouſly put forth, and act his ſtrength, ſuch an one is ſaid to be a mighty man of valour, full of courage, in this ſenſe alſo, Chriſt is a <hi>Mighty One;</hi> he hath not onely ſtrength, but he doth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily exert, and put it forth, ſo that he makes his power to be ſeene, <hi>the very ſpirit of Might doth reſt upon him,</hi> Iſa. 11.2. which he doth ſhew forth in all his workes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For one that hath rule, and Authority, he is a Mighty One, and thus Chriſt is a Mighty One.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is Mighty in regard of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and univerſality of his power, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as to the ſubject of it; it is over all, <hi>for God hath put All things in ſubjection under his feet;</hi> he hath left nothing that is not put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, he hath</p>
            <p>Firſt, All in the Church under him, All Ordinances, all offices, all gifts, all Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, all conſciences under him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. <hi>He hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, All in Heaven under him, he ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven;</hi> and it is ſaid,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42649:17"/> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. that he is gone into Heaven, and is on the right hand of God, Angels, and Authorities, and powers being made ſubject to him, ſo that all in heaven is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, the Father onely excepted, who <hi>did put all things under him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, All in Hell under him, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves being ſubject unto him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, All in this world under him, He hath all principality, power, might and Dominion under him; he hath power over all the Kings, and Kingdomes of the world, therefore he is ſaid <hi>to be the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, and to be Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</hi> Rev. 1.5. &amp; 17.14.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, All in the world to come under him; ſo much is hinted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5, 8. <hi>For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Angels hath he not put in ſubjection the world to come,</hi> that is, Honour peculiar to his Son, under whoſe feet <hi>he hath put all things in ſubjection</hi> (though now we ſee not yet all things put under him) ſo much is expreſſed <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20. <hi>God hath ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, farre above all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named not onely in this world, but alſo in that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He is Mighty in rule, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in regard of the Meaſure of it, he hath not onely power over all, but he hath
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42649:17"/> all power over all, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven, and Earth;</hi> he hath an Abſolute diſpoſe of all things; he doth whatſoever he will in the Church, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in Earth, in Hell; God hath ſet him up over all, and left all things to him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Judgement to the Son,</hi> ſo that he hath power to ſet up, and pull downe, to ſave and to deſtroy, what and whom he will. Thus it appeareth that Chriſt Jeſus is a Mighty one in every ſenſe, and acceptation of the word.</p>
            <p>Chriſt may be Conſidered,</p>
            <p>Firſt, In reſpect of his Eternall Eſſence, and being, as he was one with the Father before the Foundation of the world was laid, and ſo conſidered he is a Mighty One, the onely Mighty One from everlaſting, the true God bleſſed for ever; the Apoſtle ſpeaking of him with reference to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eſſence, ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Being in the Forme of God, thought it not Robbery to be equall with God;</hi> thus he is the Mightieſt, Higheſt God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In reſpect of his Mediatour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as he took upon him to come between God, and man, to tranſact all matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and thus conſidered, he is a Mighty One.</p>
            <div type="part">

               <p>Firſt, The ſingularity, and oneneſs of the perſon Mediating, not Many, not a Few, not two, but <hi>One Mediator</hi> between God, and man, <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. There was none with him in his difficult worke of Mediatorſhip, but he carried it on alone, there was none with him to helpe him, therefore his own Arme brought ſalvation both unto him, and us, which ſpeaks him to be a Mighty One; <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Mighty one, in that he ſtood, and that alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lord, and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> on the Mountaine, and yet but a ſhaddow of this One great Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Greatneſs of the perſons between whom he doth Mediate, he is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Mighty One that is Mediator between either Mighty Perſons or Nations, even the greateſt, mightieſt, and moſt excellent One they can finde, then how Mighty muſt he be that is Mediator between the Almighty, Higheſt God, and Man the chiefe of the Creatures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The weightineſſe of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it being of greateſt concernment, no leſs than the bringing of ſouls (which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42649:18"/> off) unto God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. the making ſinners righteous, yea righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21; the reconciling all things in heaven, and earth unto God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. the turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Gods wrath from ſinners, the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the enmity that is in their minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ſo the ſalvation of them that are loſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The exact performance, and accompliſhment of the whole buſineſs; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what was prophecied of him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>He did make reconciliation for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and brought in Everlaſting Righteouſneſſe;</hi> He did not begin, do ſomething, and then faint, and leave his work imperfect, but he finiſhed it, and that to the Glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſent him; as himſelfe teſtifieth in his prayer to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on the Earth, I have finiſhed the worke which thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> ſurely he is a Mighty One.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Demonſtrations of the Mightineſſe of Christ, the Mediator.</head>
               <p>Firſt, He is a Mighty One in his Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and riſe, from whence he came; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe told the <hi>Jews,</hi> Joh. 8.23. <hi>That he was from above, and not of this World, and that he proceeded forth, and came from God:</hi> When <hi>John</hi> heard he was come, and manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42649:19"/> by preaching, and Baptizing, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him upon this account, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.31. <hi>He that cometh from above is above all;</hi> He that cometh from Heaven is above all; And by this the Apoſtle doth diſtinguiſh him from, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt him above the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. <hi>The firſt man is of the Earth Earthly, the ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He is a Mighty One in the firſt promiſe of him, the firſt hint, and report of him is of a Mighty One, a Conquerour of the Devill, In that this bleſſed ſeed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head, according as it is written, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will put Enmity between thee, and the Woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy ſeed, and her ſeed; It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele;</hi> the firſt appearance, and coming forth of Chriſt in the promiſe, is as of a Mighty one prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt mans mightieſt Enemy, the Devill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is a Mighty One in the Types of him:</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the multitude of them, every thing almoſt (which was before him) being a Type, and ſhaddow of him, as the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Rock, Mannah, Brazen-Serpent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.32, 48, 50. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15. The Prieſts, Tabernacle, Altar, Sanctuary, the Feaſts, Sacrifices, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42649:19"/> all the Ceremoniall rites, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ad</hi> 11 verſe; <hi>Aarons</hi> Bells (as one ſaith) ſounded Jeſus Chriſt, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; ſurely he is ſome Mighty one indeed that the Lord did fore-ſignifie by ſo many things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the Mightineſs of them (I meane the perſonall Types of him) who were not meane, but mighty ones; As <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> whom God made ſo mighty, giving him Lordſhip over the Creatures, was a type of him that then was to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> that great, and mighty one, of whoſe greatneſs the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to conſider, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.4. Now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how great this man was, unto whom even the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the tenth of the ſpoils; was a Type of Chriſt. <hi>Moſes, Joſuah, David,</hi> thoſe Great, and eminent Saviours and Deliverers of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were but types and ſhaddows of that Great, and mighty Saviour, and Deliverer of his people, Jeſus Chriſt. And if the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows be thus Mighty, the body, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance muſt be very Mighty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He is a Mighty One in the Prophecies of him, I ſhall not lay any weight upon the predictions of him to the Gentiles by the famous <hi>Sybils</hi> (to whom much is attributed by ſome) who are ſaid
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42649:20"/> to Prophecy of him as of a Mighty One, an univerſall King, that ſhould be Lord over <hi>Romanes</hi> and all others;</p>
               <p>Nor yet upon Diabolicall Oracles men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Hiſtory, as the Anſwer of <hi>Apollo</hi> from <hi>Delphos</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (demanding of him, who ſhould reigne after him) after long waiting, That an Hebrew child that ruleth over the bleſſed Gods, commandeth me to leave this Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and out of hand to get me to Hell, but yet do you depart in ſilence from our Altars; which cauſed <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> after much muſing, to returne to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to build there an Altar in the Capitall, with this Inſcription (as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> affirmeth) <hi>Ara primogeniti Dei,</hi> The Altar of Gods firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son: But I paſſe by theſe things, and ſhall ſpeak of him onely as he is prophecied of in the holy Scriptures, according to which he will appeare to be a very Mighty One.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that he was prophecied of at all, for the Prophets for the moſt part fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of great things to come to paſſe. Great changes, and alterations in the world, Great deliverances, Great proſperity, Great Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and deſolations, Great Warres, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, Peſtilences; as alſo of Great and Mighty Perſons, Families, Cities, Nations, as of the five Mighty Monarchies, the Man
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42649:20"/> of ſin, that mighty one, who oppoſeth, <hi>and exalteth himſelfe above all that is called God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4. the Mighty Beaſt, whom the world worſhip, ſaying, <hi>Who is like the Beaſt? who is able to make warre with him?</hi> Rev. 13.4. The Great Whore, <hi>that ſitteth upon many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and the falſe Prophet that worketh Miracles; ſo that Chriſt is a Mighty One, being One prophecied of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In that he is prophecied of by all the Prophets in their ſeverall ages, and generations, Gods holy Prophets which have been ſince the world began, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.70. As Chriſt was in the way with the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> beginning at <hi>Moſes,</hi> and All the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; there was ſomthing in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Prophets concerning him; And this doth accord with what he minded his Diſciples of, which he had formerly ſpake to them, <hi>That all things muſt be fulfilled which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law of Moſes, and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalmes concerning him,</hi> Luk. 24, 27, 44. <hi>Philip</hi> having ſeene Jeſus, ſpeakes of him with Great affection to <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> as of a Mighty One upon this very account, <hi>We have found him of whom Moſes in the Law and the Prophets did write, Jeſus of Nazareth, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42649:21"/> ſon of Joſeph,</hi> Joh. 1.45. And <hi>Peter</hi> told the <hi>Jews,</hi> that God ſhewed by the mouth of <hi>All his Prophets,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.18. And ſpeaking of Chriſt to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and thoſe with him, ſaith, <hi>To him give All the Prophets witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. Surely he is a Mighty One of whom all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In that All of Chriſt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of, not onely his ſufferings, and the glory which ſhould follow, in the Generall, but his coming, the time, the Tribe out of which he ſhould ſpring, his birth, the place thereof, his offices, workes, particular ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, death, reſurrection, Aſcention, ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and coming againe, and whatſoever elſe was, and is to be fulfilled in him, and by him, is ſpoken of in the Prophets; And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is no Ordinary Perſon whom the Spirit of God did ſo carefully predeclare in all things belonging to him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In that he is the ſumme, and All of the Prophecies; for what are they but Chriſt in his Sufferings, and Glory, they having all ſome reference, and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy unto him; yea all the Great things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of, as the Converſion of the Jews, the coming in of the fulneſs of the Gentiles, the pulling downe high, and lofty things, the eſtabliſhing of Juſtice and righteouſneſſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42649:21"/> in the Earth, the powring out of more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the Spirit, and all other Great things, are in a ſubſerviency unto him, and have a ſpeciall reference to his exaltation, and kingdome.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In the Matter of the prophecies concerning him, which I ſhall reduce to theſe three heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What he ſhall be, and have; <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> prophecying of <hi>Iſraels</hi> happineſs, ſaith, <hi>His King ſhall be higher then Agag, and his kngdome ſhall he exalted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of Jacob ſhall come he that ſhall have dominion,</hi> Numb. 24.7, 19. The Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>That he ſhall have the Heathen for his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion,</hi> Pſal. 2.8. He ſhall be exalted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled, and be very high, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.13. He ſhall have a portion with the Great, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſpoile with the ſtrong, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. He ſhall not onely be Ruler in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo Great unto the ends of the Earth, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> 5.2, 4. Yea, he ſhall be King over all the Earth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What he ſhall do; He ſhall judge the poore of the people, he ſhall ſave the children of the needy, and ſhall breake in pieces the Oppreſſor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.4. He ſhall rule in the midſt of his Enemies, he ſhall Judge among the Heathen, he ſhall fill the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42649:22"/> places with the dead bodies, he ſhall wound the Heads over many Countreys, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2, 6. He ſhall ſmite the Earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips ſhall he ſlay the wicked, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.4. He ſhall reigne and proſper, and ſhall execute Judgement and Juſtice in the earth; He ſhall build the Temple of the Lord, and he ſhall beare the Glory, and ſhall ſit and rule up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.13. He ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Beaſt, and the Kings of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.19, 20. Theſe and other mighty things are ſpoken of Chriſt that he ſhould do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What others ſhall be, and do towards him. Unto him ſhall the Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people be, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. To him ſhall the Gentil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſeeke, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.10. The Kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him, they ſhall be dumb, and not dare to ſpeak in his preſence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.15. They that dwell in the Wilderneſs ſhall bow before him, and his Enemies ſhall lick the duſt; The Kings of <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> and the Iſles ſhall bring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; the Kings of <hi>Sheba</hi> and <hi>Seba</hi> ſhall offer gifts; yea all Kings ſhall fall downe before him, and all Nations ſhall ſerve him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.9, 10, 11. At his Name every knee ſhall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth and things under the earth, and every
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42649:22"/> tongue ſhall confeſſe that he is Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. All which ſpeak Chriſt to be a Mighty One.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He is a <hi>Mighty One</hi> in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the people.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the expectation it ſelf; he was one lookt for before his coming, the people were in expectation of him, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the people is not ordinarily of mean and ordinary perſons, like themſelves but of great and mighty ones, of ſuch, as ſome way or other excell others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the nature and manner of their expectation, it was not a faint and dull, but a ſtrong and earneſt expectation; they did expect him, and expect him much, they did expect him with deſire and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to his own words to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>I tell you that many Prophets and Kings have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, Luke</hi> 10.24. Therefore when God ſent any one into the world more excellent than others, they thought it might be he. The <hi>Jews</hi> as ſoon as they heard of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt preaching and baptizing in the wilderneſſe, ſent Prieſts and Levites from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ask him, <hi>Who he was?</hi> ſuſpecting he might be the Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.19. And when Chriſt was come, they not knowing it was he, came round
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42649:23"/> about him as he was in Temple, and ſaid unto him, <hi>How long doſt thou make us to doubt?</hi> (or <hi>Doſt thou kill us?</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>If thou be the Chriſt tell us plainly, John</hi> 10.24. So great, and earneſt was their expectation of him, and ſurely he is ſome mighty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent one indeed, that is the ſtrong and earneſt expectation of the people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the matter of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they looked that he ſhould come, ſo they looked that he ſhould be a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> and do great things when he came, That he ſhould be a Redeemer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a Reſtorer of the Kingdome, which is evident from the words of the two deſponding Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to himſelf, <hi>We truſted that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael, Luke</hi> 24.21. And ſo much may be gathered from the words of the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> to him, <hi>I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt, when he is come he will tell us all things, Jo.</hi> 4.25. Her expectation of him was as of a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> ſurpaſſing all the Prophets which were before; and ſuch was the expectation of <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luke 2.25. <hi>He waited for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of Iſrael,</hi> whom when he ſaw, he called <hi>Gods ſalvation,</hi> verſ. 30.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the continuance of their expectation, they waited long in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and though he came not, yet
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42649:23"/> they held up their expectation of him, and did not faint in their minds, but lived and dyed in expectation of him.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, A <hi>Mighty One</hi> in his Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that he had a fore-runner, they are Mighty, not mean ones that have fore-runners to prepare the way for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch an One was Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In that he had ſuch a fore-runner, a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> for ſo the Angel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him to his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. <hi>He ſhall be great in the ſight of the Lord, he ſhall be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, even from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, and many of the children of Iſrael ſhall he turn to the Lord their God, and ſhall go before him in the ſpirit and power of Elias; &amp;c.</hi> And ſo his Father being filled with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit prophecyed of him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 76. <hi>Thou child ſhalt be called the Prophet of the higheſt, for thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his way:</hi> Yea, he was ſo mighty as Chriſt himſelf teſtifieth of him, <hi>That among them that are born of women, there hath not riſen a greater than John;</hi> and yet he but Chriſts fore-runner; he that comes after, is always mightier than the fore-runner, and ſo <hi>John</hi> witneſſed, <hi>He that cometh after me is mightier than I, Matth.</hi> 3.11.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, A <hi>Mighty One</hi> in his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42649:24"/> That he who is over all, God bleſſed for ever, ſhould take our fleſh, and dwell among us; that there ſhould be a conjunction of two ſo infinitely differing Natures, the Divine and Humane, in the Unity of one Perſon, remaining uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and unconfounded together, that he in whom the fullneſſe of the man-hood dwelleth, is not One, and he in whom the fullneſſe of the God-head, another; but he in whom the fullneſs of both natures dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, is one and the ſame, is very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and a great Myſtery, and muſt needs ſpeak the perſon to be ſome mighty and extraordinary One indeed, being both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God, and perfect man, and ſo every way fit for any undertaking, to do and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing; for as man he could ſuffer, but not overcome the ſharpneſſe of death, as God he could ſuffer nothing, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any thing; and thus incarnate, he became a <hi>Mighty One</hi> in our Nature for us, fit to ſave us.</p>
               <p>The Incarnation of Chriſt doth eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend his conception and birth, in both which he appears to be a <hi>Mighty One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, In his Conception, which was not common nor ordinary, for he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the power of Nature, as all other <hi>Mighty Ones</hi> are, but <hi>By the power of the Holy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42649:24"/> Spirit,</hi> Matth. 1.18. His Mother <hi>Mary</hi> was found with Child of the Holy Ghoſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of the Angel to her, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhaddow thee. Nonus modus novi hominis,</hi> A new way of conceiving this new man; for a woman that knew not man to conceive a man in her womb, is the new and ſtrange thing which the Lord hath created in the earth; <hi>A woman ſhall compaſſe a man, Jer.</hi> 31.21. And while <hi>Joſeph</hi> was troubled about this matter, an Angel was ſent from Heaven to ſatisfie him, which ſaid to him, <hi>Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghoſt, Matth.</hi> 1.20. Certainly he was ſome <hi>Mighty One,</hi> who was thus conceived, and whoſe Conception was thus declared and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Angels.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In his Birth, he was not only born, but born a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of the Angel to the Shepherds, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.11. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you is born this day in the City of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord. A King,</hi> as the Wiſe men ſtiled him in their inquiry after him, Math. 2.2. <hi>Where is he that is born King of the Jews?</hi> And he was not only Mighty in his birth, becauſe he was born a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> but alſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42649:25"/> in his birth it ſelfe, it being a more than ordinary birth, To awake (ſaith one) the world to look for ſtrange things in this life, to ſignifie that he ſhould be a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> and do wonderfull things, the ſtrange Births of perſons did uſually ſpeak ſome Extraordinarines to be in their lives, as in <hi>Iſaac, Jacob, Samuel, Sampſon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Mightineſſe of Chriſt in his Birth will further appear.</head>
               <p>Firſt, In the ſubject of it, not only a Woman, but a Virgin, ſo wonderfull a thing that it was given for a ſign unto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers divers hundred of years before it was accompliſhed, even a ſign of Gods own chooſing among all the wonders in the depth, <hi>and in the height above, Iſa:</hi> 7.11.14. The Virgin bearing this Son againſt the common order of Nature, without a man, whence he is called <hi>The ſeed of the Woman;</hi> this <hi>Mary</hi> thought a thing impoſſible, when it was told her by the Angel, and ſaid, <hi>How ſhal this be ſeeing I know not man? Luke</hi> 1.34.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the time of it, when the three Monarchies of the <hi>Aſſyrians, Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> were ended, and the <hi>Romans</hi> entred into the fourth, which was greater and mightier than the former; this <hi>Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty One</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt durſt ſhew himſelf in his loweſt and weakeſt eſtate,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42649:25"/> when the world was at the higheſt and ſtrongeſt, and then begin to build up a Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the Concomitants of it; divers remarkable things accompanyed his Birth, which ſpeaks forth his Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, The meſſage of the Angel to the Shepherds, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all People; For unto you is born this day in the City of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The praiſings of the Hoſt, the Shepherds they glorified and praiſed God for what they had heard and ſeen; but men of the earth are not ſufficient for this thing, and therefore a Quire is ſent from Heaven to rejoyce and ſing praiſes to the Moſt High for this Heavenly and unſpeakable gift, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13. <hi>Suddenly, there was with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel a multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt praiſing God.</hi> Theſe extraordinary praiſes ſpeak the perſon born to be ſome great and <hi>Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The homage of the Wiſe men, That they ſhould come to tender their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſervice to this Infant, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Herod,</hi> nor <hi>Aguſtus Caeſar,</hi> of whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe no doubt they had heard (but did not eſteem nor regard it in compariſon of this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42649:26"/> late born King of the <hi>Jews</hi>) ſpeaks Chriſt to be a <hi>Mighty One;</hi> eſpecially if we conſider</p>
               <p>Firſt, The quality of their Perſons; if becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Wiſe men, is uſually taken in the worſt ſenſe, for men practiſing Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and unlawful Arts, it ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo in this place; it ſhews forth the more of the Mightineſs and Power of Chriſt, when men that had been of ſuch a profeſſion become ſuch profeſſors of Chriſt of any among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as to come and do homage to him: howſoever, foraſmuch as they were (as is moſt likely, not of the meaner ſort, nor yet perſons of ordinary and common gifts, but men of learning, underſtanding, wiſdome, and of high eſteem among the People; it holds forth the greatneſs and excelleny of Chriſt, that ſuch ſhould come ſo early, and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him</p>
               <p>Secondly, The greatneſs of their pains, without doubt it was a long and tedious journey they took, although we cannot tell exactly how far they came, becauſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular term from whence (at which divers have diverſly conjectured) is not to be found in Scripture, onely it is ſaid (with an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Behold, prefixed, as a matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that they ſhould come, and come ſo far) <hi>They came from the Eaſt to Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42649:26"/> and ſurely they would not have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch a journey with regard to an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary common perſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The reality and fulneſſe of their homage; it was not in word, and in tongue onely, but in truth and in deed; we do not read of any thing they ſaid to him, but of what they did, and that was much, they firſt gave themſelves an oblation to this great King, and then made offering of their gifts; <hi>For they fell down and worſhipped him, and when they had opened their treaſures, they preſented unto him Gifts, Gold and Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and myrrhe,</hi> Matth. 2.11. They would not have tendered ſuch large homage to a mean one.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The eminent appearing of God for their direction to him, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in returning; a Star did lead them to the very place where he was for it is ſaid, Math. 2.9. <hi>Lo, the Star which they ſaw in the Eaſt went before them till it came and ſtood over where the young Child was.</hi> And for their preſervation, <hi>God did warn them in a dream, that they ſhould not return to Herod, and they departed into their own Countrey another way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The dread of the Mighty, even of King <hi>Herod</hi> and all <hi>Jeruſalem with him,</hi> for it is ſaid, <hi>When Herod the King heard theſe things (viz:</hi> of one born King of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42649:27"/> 
                  <hi>Jews,</hi> and of perſons come to worſhip him) <hi>he was troubled, terrified,</hi> yea, <hi>he ſhaked with fear, (Mat.</hi> 2.3.) ſo that Chriſt was a <hi>Mighty One</hi> in his Birth.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Chriſt is a <hi>Mighty One</hi> in his Deſcent, even after the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of his ſtock in general, for he was deſcended of the Patriarchs, he was of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that Mighty One; the <hi>Jews</hi> counted it a great priviledge above what the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had, <hi>That they had Abraham to their Father,</hi> that they were of his ſtock, branches of that root, Chriſt was alſo a ſon of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In reſpect of his Tribe out of which he ſprang, <hi>Judah;</hi> for it is evident that our Lord ſprang out of <hi>Judah,</hi> and it is as evident alſo, that <hi>Judah</hi> was the mightieſt Tribe, both according to <hi>Jacobs,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> bleſſing of him, <hi>Gen:</hi> 49.8. <hi>Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren ſhall praiſe, thine hand ſhall be in the neck of thine enemies, thy fathers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall bow before thee, Judah is a Lyons whelp,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 33.7. <hi>Let his hands be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for him, and be thou an help to him from his e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emies. Judah</hi> was Standard-bearer in the foremoſt Quarter as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> encamped about the Tabernacle, <hi>Numb:</hi> 2.3. And <hi>Judah's</hi> Standard (Lyon-like) mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the firſt place, as they marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42649:27"/> the Land of <hi>Canaan, Numb:</hi> 10.13, 14. and of this mighty Tribe was Chriſt, yea, he was the <hi>Mighty One</hi> of this Tribe, <hi>The Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tribe of Judah,</hi> Rev: 5.5.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Judah</hi> was the Royal Tribe, the Royalty of a Kingdome appertained to it, Gen: 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah,</hi> &amp;c. The Kings and Rulers deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from thence; and this ſpeaks the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe and exeellency of Chriſt, that he was of this Tribe, hence Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt was the moſt excellent and notable One that ever was, deſcending of the eternall Father, as he is the Son of God, and as he is man deſcending of the Patriarchs, and of the renowned Kings of Judah.</hi> And it is ſtoried that it remaineth regiſtred in the <hi>Jews</hi> Talmud it ſelf, <hi>That Jeſus of Nazareth crucified, was of the blood-royal from Zorobabel of the houſe of David;</hi> ſo that he is a <hi>Mighty One</hi> in his Deſcent.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Mighty in his Name; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying of him, ſaith, Ch. 9.6. <hi>His Name ſhall be called Wonderful, Councellour, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace, Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins, Immanuel, the Word of God;</hi> his name ſpeak forth his excellency and might, not that there is any might and virtue in the bare name it ſelfe, as conſiſting of ſo many let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as ſome have fondly conceited, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42649:28"/> the bare name of Chriſt uſed, had power to drive away the Devil, and that the name of Chriſt written and carried about with them, was of efficacy to keep them from danger, but his name declare his nature, for as his name is, ſo is he; it is not with Chriſt in this reſpect as with ſome who had names contrary to their natures, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to hide their weakneſſes, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes, as the <hi>Impius</hi> named <hi>Pius;</hi> the <hi>Coward, Leo;</hi> the <hi>Cruel, Clemens;</hi> the <hi>Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, Innocentius,</hi> the Earthly-minded, <hi>Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, Mighty in his Titles, I ſhall name a few; <hi>The Captain of Salvation, Ruler in Iſrael, The Conſolation of Iſrael, The Horn of Salvation, The Deliverer, The Power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, The Lyon of the Tribe of Judah, Lord, The Lord frequently.</hi> It is divers hundred times ſimply and abſolutely aſcribed unto Chriſt, <hi>The Lord of the Harveſt, The Lord of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, The Lord of the Sabbath, The Lord our Righteouſneſſe, The Lord of Life, The Lord of Glory, Lord of Lords, King of Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eleventhly, He was a <hi>Mighty One</hi> in his Preſentation, which though in it ſelf, it was but for his Parents to do for him after the cuſtom of the Law, in which reſpect he was but as others, yet that two ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons, both of ſingular ſanctity
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42649:28"/> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould (by the ſpecial dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Spirit) come into the Temple at that time when Jeſus was there in his mothers arms, and acknowledge, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him publickly, with great affection and thankſgiving to be the Meſſias and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world, doth ſpeak him to be ſome <hi>Mighty One,</hi> Luke 2. from the 22. to the 40. <hi>verſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Twelfthly, Mighty in his Baptiſme, which though in it ſelf, it was but ordinary, with water by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan,</hi> both as, and where others were, and by him alſo by whom others were baptized, yet it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with three wonders; <hi>For ſtraightway coming up out of the waters, the Heavens were opened unto him, and the Spirit of God deſcended like a Dove and lighted upon him, and there came a voice from Heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed, Matth.</hi> 3.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, Mighty in his faſting, ſo mighty that he faſted forty dayes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nights, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.2. And it was not a partial, but a total abſtinence from natural food, for in thoſe dayes he did eat nothing, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.2. Neither was he hungry all that time (for ſo much is neceſſarily implyed, Matt. 4.2. <hi>When he had faſted forty dayes and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</hi> And
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42649:29"/> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> (having ſpoken of the forty dayes, the time of his faſt) ſaith, <hi>When they were ended, he afterward hungred. Moſes</hi> indeed faſted the ſame ſpace of time, but there was this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable difference between Chriſt and <hi>Moſes</hi> in this reſpect: <hi>Moſes</hi> faſted on the Mount, where he was eminently aſſiſted, and ſatisfied by his beſt and greateſt friend, The Lord, <hi>Exod:</hi> 34.28. Chriſt in the Wilderneſſe where he was violently aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and troubled by his worſt and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt adverſary the Devil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.1, 2. This is enough to manifeſt his mightineſſe in this particular.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, Mighty in his Tranſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, which was a glimpſe of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he was transfigured before the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>And his face did ſhine as the Sun, and his rayment was white as the light;</hi> ſo exceedingly glorious was he, <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo affected with it, as he deſired the continuance of it, he ſaid unto Jeſus, <hi>Lord it is good for us to be here, if thou wilt let us make here three Tabernacles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Math.</hi> 17.2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, Mighty in the Teſtimony which is given of him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Teſtimony of himſelf, <hi>I am one that bear witneſſe of my ſelf,</hi> John 8.18. And he did teſtifie of himſelf, that he was a <hi>mighty One, That he was the ſon of God, Greater
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42649:29"/> than the Temple, greater than Solomon, That he had overcome the world, That if a man had kept his ſaying, he ſhould never ſee death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and his own teſtimony is true.</hi> But foraſmuch as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov:</hi> 27.2. <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and not thine own mouth, a ſtranger, and not thine own lips.</hi> I ſhall conſider chiefly what others witneſſe of him.</p>
               <p>Secondly. The Teſtimony of the Father who ſent him, bare witneſſe of him, The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath teſtified from Heaven that he is his beloved Son, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Lo a voice from Heaven, ſaying, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> The Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> noteth, that when God bringeth in the firſt begotten into the world, he ſaith, <hi>And let all the Angels of God worſhip him, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Son</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever, Heb.</hi> 1, 6, 8. The Father te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of him as of a <hi>mighty One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Teſtimony of the Spirit, I ſhall inſtance only in that to <hi>John</hi> by Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rev:</hi> 1.12, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>I ſaw ſeaven golden Candleſticks, and in the midſt of the ſeven Candleſticks one like unto the Son of man, cloathed with a Garment down to the foot, and girt about the Paps with a Golden Girdle, his head and his hairs were white like Wool, as white as Snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine braſſe, as if they burned in a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42649:30"/> and his voice as the ſound of many waters. And he had in his right hand ſeven Stars, and out of his mouth went a ſharp two edged ſword, and his Countenance was as the Sun ſhineth in his ſtrength,</hi> This was a Viſion of the Son of God, The <hi>mighty One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And according to this Viſion are thoſe ſeven Titles of Chriſt, given to him by the Spirit, mentioned in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that holdeth the ſeven Stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midſt of the ſeven Golden Candleſticks,</hi> Rev: 2.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt and the laſt, which was dead, and is alive,</hi> verſ. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath the ſharp Sword with two edges,</hi> verſ. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine Braſſe,</hi> verſ. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That hath the ſeven Spirits of God, and the ſeaven Stars,</hi> Rev. 3.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That is holy, that is true, that hath the Key of David, he that openeth, and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth, and no man openeth,</hi> verſ. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Amen, the faithfull and true Witneſſe, the Beginning of the Creation of God,</hi> verſ. 14. All which ſpeak forth the mightineſs of Chriſt</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Teſtimony of faithfull men, as the Teſtimony of the Prophets, of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42649:30"/> 
                  <hi>John</hi> who was a man ſent from God on purpoſe to beare witneſs of him; whoſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of him is recorded, <hi>John</hi> 1.15.32, 33, 34. The teſtimony of the foure Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, as alſo of the Apoſtles, who have all ſpoken of him, as of a Mighty One; And it were eaſie (if needfull) to add the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of other Ancient Writers, of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, of holy Martyrs, and many eminent Confeſſors of Chriſt, who do agree in their Teſtimony with thoſe fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Teſtimony of Angels, thoſe glorious Creatures did teſtifie of him, as of a Mighty One, ſo they teſtified of him.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Math. 1.20, 21. <hi>While he thought on theſe things, the Angel of the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto him in a dreame, ſaying, Joſeph, thou ſon of David, feare not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the holy Ghoſt. And ſhee ſhall bring forth a ſon, and thou ſhalt call his Name</hi> Jeſus; for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Mary,</hi> Luke 1.30, 31, 32, 33. <hi>The Angel ſaid unto her, feare not, Mary, for thou haſt found favour with God; And behold, thou ſhalt conceive in thy wombe, and bring forth a ſon, and ſhalt call his Name</hi> Jeſus, he ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the Son of the Higheſt, and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42649:31"/> throne of his father David, and he ſhall reigne over the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdome there ſhall be no end.</p>
               <p>To the Shepheards, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>The Angel ſaid unto them, feare not; for behold, I bring you good tydings of Great joy which ſhall be to all people; for unto you is borne this day, in the City of David,</hi> A Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The teſtimony of Enemies, and the teſtimony of Adverſaries, is of greateſt validity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves teſtified that he was a Mighty One, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.47, 48. <hi>The chiefe Prieſts, and the Phariſees gathered a Councel, and ſaid, What do we? for this man doth many miracles; If we let him thus alone, all men will beleeve on him;</hi> ſo likewiſe, <hi>John</hi> 12.19. <hi>The Phariſees ſaid among themſelves; Perceive ye, how ye prevaile nothing; behold the world is gone after him. Joſephus</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> who was borne not long after Chriſt, writeth; <hi>There was at this time One Jeſus a wiſe man, if it be lawfull to call him a Man, a worker of moſt wonderfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and a Maſter, and Teacher of all ſuch men as are willingly content to embrace the truth.</hi> Yea the <hi>Jews</hi> do grant, and record Chriſts miracles, and make mention of many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes which Jeſus did that are not written by our Evangeliſts; As the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42649:31"/> of the book call'd <hi>Proofes of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> obſerveth.</p>
               <p>The very <hi>Turkes</hi> give this teſtimony of him, <hi>That he was a great Prophet, Mighty in word, and deed; and that the Jews did evill in crucifying of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea the Devils themſelves confeſſed, and acknowledg'd him to be a Mighty One; For they came out of many, crying out, ſaying, <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the Son of God,</hi> Luk. 4.41. So <hi>verſ.</hi> 33, 34. <hi>A man which had a ſpirit of an uncleane Devil, cryed out with a lowd voice, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let us alone, what have we to do with thee, Thou Jeſus of Nazareth? art thou come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us? I know thee who thou art, The holy One of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixteenthly, Mighty in ſame, he is of Great fame; In the dayes of his fleſh as ſoone as ever he began to preach, and work miracles, his fame went thorowout all <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> In what Land, or Country ſoever he was, his fame ſpread abroad in all that Country; his fame was not onely ſpread thorowout all the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo into many other Nations of the world, by the Preaching of the Apoſtles; for he ſent them into all Nations, into all the world, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. (Repentance, and remſſion of ſin being to be preached in his Name among all Nations, beginning at
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42649:32"/> 
                  <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) and they accordingly went, and made him knowne where ever they came, and the word of the Lord mightily prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and his fame hath ſpread abroad ever ſince; It hath of late ſpread in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other parts, ſo that his Name is Great in the world, his fame is gone into all Lands, even the fame of him as of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, a deliverer, a Mighty One.</p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, Mighty in his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; Not onely men, Diſciples, but the Angels alſo miniſtred unto him; The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels declared his Conception, and birth, and attended him; when borne, an Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to direct <hi>Joſeph,</hi> for his preſervation, <hi>Math.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Saying ariſe, and take the young child, and his mother and flee into Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. When he had been tempted of the Devil, Angels came and miniſtred unto him, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.11. When he was in his ſufferings, there appeared an Angel unto him from heaven ſtrengthening him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. At his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection an Angel from heaven came, and rolled back the ſtone from the doore of the Sepulchre, and ſate upon it, and declared his Reſurrection to the Women, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.2, 5, 6. Yea two Angels in white ſate, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jeſus had layen, <hi>John</hi> 20.12. When he aſcended two Angels attended
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42649:32"/> him, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.10. When he ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he ſhall come attended with his Mighty Angels, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. For he ſhall come in his Glory, and all the holy Angels with him, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.31. And when he ſhall ſit upon the throne of his glory, thouſand thouſands ſhall miniſter unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands ſtand before him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11.</p>
               <p>Eighteenthly, A Mighty One in holineſs, and righteouſneſs, ſo holy, as he is called, by way of eminency, <hi>The holy One,</hi> Act. 3.14. The holy one of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.34. None ſo holy as he; ſo righteous, as he is called alſo <hi>the righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. <hi>The juſt, Act.</hi> 3.14. Righteous before God; The Lord calls him his <hi>Righteous ſervant,</hi> Iſa. 53.11. Righteous alſo before men, even Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>Pilate</hi> who condemned him, did a little before pronounce him a Juſt perſon, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.24. he took water, and waſhed his hands before the multitude, ſaying, I am innocent of the blood of <hi>this Juſt perſon;</hi> And <hi>Judas</hi> who betrayed him, cleared Chriſt, and accuſed himſelfe, ſaying, I have ſinned in that I have betrayed <hi>the innocent blood,</hi> Math. 27.4.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:42649:33"/>
               <head>His mightineſs, and eminency in holineſs, and righteouſneſs doth appeare.</head>
               <p>Firſt, Generally, in his obedience to the will of God, he ſaid he came downe from heaven, not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he made that his great buſineſs, and deſigne, while he was on earth, his mightineſs therein may be ſeene.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the univerſality of it, he did whatſoever his Father required, and left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his will undone, he kept the whole Law, and offended not in One point, he did not onely the eaſieſt, and pleaſant, but alſo the hardeſt, and moſt grievous part of his fathers will; when his ſoul was exceeding ſorrowfull even unto death, he prayed not ſo much for the removing of that Cup, as that his fathers will might be done, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.39, 42. Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In the exactneſs, and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; he kept the whole Law exactly, as he was not wanting in the matter, ſo he did not faile in the manner of performing his fathers will; there was no defects, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lacking in his obedience, he did all things well; what we are preſſing towards,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42649:33"/> and reaching forth unto, he attained, he was perfect in every good worke, and ſtood compleate in the whole will of his father, and hence it is that it is recorded of him, <hi>that he was without ſin, knew no ſin, did no ſin;</hi> which could not be, if he had failed in any thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the Conſtancy of it; Chriſt did not obey by fits but conſtantly; though we cannot, he continued in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them; This righteous one held on his way, he did not faile, nor was he diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, yea when perſecution and tribulation did ariſe againſt him becauſe of his doing the will of his father, he was not offended; but did alwayes do the things which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his father, as he told the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.29. all which ſpeakes forth his might.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In his delight in it, his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was without murmuring, or grudging, it was with delight; <hi>for the Law of God was within his heart,</hi> as he ſpake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will, O my God;</hi> his fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements were not grievous to him; he profeſſed to his Diſciples, <hi>That it was his Meat to do the will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his worke,</hi> Joh. 4.34.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In the efficacy, and vertue of it, his Righteouſneſſe doth not returne to him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42649:34"/> void, but it doth accompliſh that which he pleaſe, and proſper in the thing whereto he ordaines it, and that is the making others righteous; according to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>For as by one mans diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be</hi> made Righteous; <hi>God made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. And accordingly we are; <hi>for of God he is made</hi> unto us Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; Now ſurely he is Mighty in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, whoſe obedience effect the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Particularly in the Graces of the Spirit which were in him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In his Faith; for he, as well as we, had faith, and that a greater, and ſtronger than ours; for he was ſo ſtrong, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in faith, as that he ſtagger'd not at any of the promiſes of his father through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe; other mighty ones in faith, ſometimes feared, as <hi>Jacob, David</hi> &amp;c. but Chriſts faith was perfect, he was never afraid of any ttouble, or any perſecutors, he knew on whom he had beleeved, he knew his father would uphold, and reward him; his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his father is prophetically ſpoken of by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 50.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheekes to them that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42649:34"/> pluckt off the haire; I hid not my face from ſhame, and ſpitting, for the Lord God will help me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall I not be confounded; therefore have I ſet my face like a flint, and I know that I ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> &amp;c. And he expreſſed as much at the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus; Father I thanke thee that thou haſt heard me, and I know that thou heareſt me alwayes;</hi> he was mighty and ſtrong in faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His love, he was and is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that grace, which I ſhall illuſtrate in particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the nature of it, it is above or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary common love, above the love of one friend to another; of a father to his child, of an husband to his wife, or of a man to his own ſelf; it is ſuch a love wherewith the father hath loved him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9. He tells his Diſciples, <hi>As the father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you;</hi> which words do not only hold forth the truth, but the excellency of his love towards them, it being tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, infinite love, without meaſure, above Geometrie, above all arts, and parts of men; the Apoſtle tells the Saints at <hi>Epheſus, that it paſſeth knowledge,</hi> Eph. 3.19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the objects of it, not his friends as loving him any thing, though his friends as loved by him, not Saints, or any excellent lovely ones, but ſinners, enemies,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42649:35"/> and he is a Mighty one that can love Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; fleſh and blood cannot do this; <hi>Paul</hi> ſets forth the greatneſs of the love of Chriſt by the objects of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8. <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly, for ſcarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure for a good man ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me would even dare to die; but God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Chriſt died for us;</hi> he was ſo mighty in his love, that he loved his greateſt, mightieſt enemies, even thoſe that took away his life, yea when they were taking it away, at that inſtant, when it was doing, when he did hang on the croſſe, when they were in the heate of their malice, and hatred againſt him, he pray'd for the choiceſt bleſſing for them, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the vertue, and operation of it, it did produce wonderfull effects, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him out.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To the loweſt Condition, love brought him from heaven to earth, from the higheſt to the loweſt eſtate, from the throne to the dunghil; Though he was Lord over all, yet love made him a ſervant to all, and that is the loweſt condition to be a ſervant; this the Apoſtle mentions, as the infinite condeſcention of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42649:35"/> And this himſelfe minded his Diſciples of, <hi>that he the Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter,</hi> Math. 20.28. <hi>I am among you as he that ſerveth,</hi> Luk. 22.27.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To the meaneſt ſervices, who though he was the moſt Mighty One, yet ſo great was his love, as that he did not onely condeſcend to men of low eſtate, but to the loweſt, meaneſt ſervices for them, <hi>John</hi> 13. from the firſt to the ſeventeenth verſe is a full teſtimony of his love in this reſpect; that he, their Lord, and Maſter, ſhould waſh his Diſciples feet.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To the Greateſt ſufferings, both in life, and death; his life was a life of ſorrow and trouble, and his death was a a death of great paine, and ignominy, the curſed death of the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To the largeſt communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he hath witneſſed the greatneſs of his love by the largeneſs of his gifts; he hath given himſelfe, This the Apoſtle mentions as the evidence of the Greatneſs, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his love to the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2, 25. that he loved the Church, and gave himſelfe for it, and not only himſelfe to die for it, but now that he liveth, he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth freely to it of all ſpirituall bleſſings; for whatſoever he hath heard, or received of his father, that he imparts to his friends.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:42649:36"/>
               <p>Fourthly, In the duration of it, it is for ever, he abides in his love towards them, notwithſtanding all their unkindneſſes, its immutable, no length of time, nor diſtance of place, can worke any alteration in his love, the injuries that we do to Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have their fruit in diſcomfort, and occaſion the ſuſpenſion of the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his love for a ſeaſon, (which is a burden very grievous to be borne by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoule) yet theſe do not remove his love to his; yea though <hi>he viſit their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes, yet his loving kindneſs ſhall continue with them;</hi> in a word, it is <hi>Everlaſting love,</hi> Jer. 31.3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His ſelf-deniall, he was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that, he was higher, and greater then any, then all, he had more then all others, and yet he forſooke all for others, he emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied himſelfe of all, never any ſo high, and never any ſo low, never any ſo rich, and never any ſo poor as he; never any ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and never any counted ſo vile; and this not by conſtraint, but willingly; for as the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. obſerves, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo, yea when worldly honour was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, (for the people would have made him a King, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.15.) he refuſed it; this was great ſelf-denial; to lay aſide a crowne when he had it, and to refuſe it when it was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42649:36"/> offered, ſpeakes him one Mighty in this Grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His patience; he had greateſt patience in greateſt ſufferings, others were not ſo patient in leſſer ſufferings, as he was in greateſt; The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſets him forth in his great ſufferings, and withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his incomparable patience, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. which he uſhers in with a yet—<hi>yet he opened not his mouth, he is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb, ſo he openeth not his mouth; when he was reviled, reviled not againe, when he ſuffered, he threatned not;</hi> patience was perfect in him; <hi>he was ſtrengthened with all might unto All pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and long ſuffering with joyfulneſs;</hi> yea the patience of Chriſt in his moſt grievous ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings was ſo abſolute, that in all that his enemies tongues, and hands could ſay, or do, this Servant of God did not ſin, ſo much as in word, but offered the ſacrifice of prayer and ſupplications with the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for his perſecutors, he was Mighty in this Grace.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, His zeale; he was earneſt, and fervent in Spirit againſt all evil, and for that which was good, <hi>he did cry aloud, he ſpared not, but lifted up his voice like a Trumpet, and ſhewed the people their tranſgreſſion;</hi> he was full of zeale againſt the ſins of the Scribes, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42649:37"/> Phariſees, freely denouncing woes againſt them, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. He was full of zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prophanation, and prophaners of the Temple, <hi>he overthrew the money-changers, and the ſeats of them that ſold doves,</hi> and would not ſuffer that any man ſhould carry any veſſell thorow the Temple, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.15, 16. <hi>Yea be made a ſcourge of ſmall coards, and he drove them all out of the Temple, and ſaid to them that ſold doves, take theſe things hence, make not my fathers houſe an houſe of Merchandize; And his Diſciples remembred that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, The zeale of thine houſe hath e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ten me up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, His wiſdome, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he was of quick, and great underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he was but twelve yeares old, all that heard him, queſtioning, and anſwering the Doctors, were aſtoniſhed at his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and Anſwers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.47. He was wiſer than all his Enemies, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entangle him in his talke; when he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to any thing, it was with ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as they durſt not ask him any more Queſtions, and no man was able to anſwer him; he was of ſo great underſtanding that he knew all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, <hi>and needed not that any ſhould teſtifie of man; for he knew what was in man, Joh.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>Yea he knew their very thoughts, Math.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.8. He had (as the School-men ſpeak) both <hi>Cognitionem matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinam,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42649:37"/> &amp; verſpertinam,</hi> both a morning, and evening knowledge, he knew things in their Cauſes, as well as in their natures and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, His faithfulneſs was great, without the leaſt leaven of hypocriſie, there was no guile found in his mouth, neither was there any in his Spirit; he was faithfull to his father, he did his work, and glorified his Name on Earth; was faithfull to his Diſciples, he made knowne unto them all things that he had heard of his father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. He acquainted them with ſufferings as well as the Glory that ſhould follow; he reproved them for their evils, as well as comforted them in their troubles; he was faithfull to all, doing good unto all men, as he had opportunity.</p>
               <p>Nineteenthly, A mighty one in his works, he was mighty in deed, excellent in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; his works (as himſelfe ſaid) did beare witneſs of him, that he was ſome mighty one ſent from God, he hath declared his ſtrength among the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His works were of two ſorts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Spirituall, and heavenly, relating to the ſouls and ſpirits of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, More externall, and viſible, relating to the bodies of men, and others,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42649:38"/> and he was mighty in hoth ſorts.</p>
            </div>

               <head>His works relating to the ſoules of men were chiefly.</head>
               <p>Firſt, His preaching and teaching, in which he was mighty, even in his firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount; <hi>The people were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine, for he taught them as one having Authority, and not as the Scribes,</hi> Math. 7.28, 29. <hi>Being in Galilee, he taught in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, being Glorified of all; He came to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, and taught, and all bare him witneſs, and wondered at the Gracious words which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of his mouth; he came downe to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, and taught, and they were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine: for his word was with power;</hi> ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 4.14, 15, 16, 22, 31, 32. To theſe may be added the Officers anſwer to the chiefe Prieſts and Phariſees, when they ſaid unto them; <hi>Why have you not brought him? Never man ſpake like this man,</hi> Joh. 7.45, 46. <hi>Neither did the word of Chriſt returne unto him void, but did exceedingly proſper in the thing whereto it was ſent, many beleeved on him,</hi> Joh. 4.41. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.42.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His Praying, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of Grace and Supplication without meaſure, he muſt needs be mighty in prayer, and ſo he was, <hi>In the dayes of his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42649:38"/> fleſh he offered up prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and tears, Heb:</hi> 5.7. Sometimes he prayed long, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. He continued all night in prayer to God, ſometimes he prayed more earneſtly, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſucceſſefully; <hi>For as a Mighty Prince he had power with God, and ever prevailed.</hi> God made him a King, &amp; then bid him ask, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. and indeed he prayed like a King, like a <hi>mighty One,</hi> as one in joynt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with his Father (as one hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Baptizing, <hi>John,</hi> and Chriſts Diſciples could but Baptize with water in his name, he the maſter only was, and is mighty to baptize with the holy Spirit. This was that great and wonderfull thing which was made known to <hi>John,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould do, which he was to obſerve as that wherein Chriſt excelleth all others, as is manifeſt in the record of <hi>John; John</hi> 1.32, 33. <hi>John bear record, ſaying, I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from Heaven like a Dove, and it abode upon him, and I knew him not, but he that ſent me to baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on him, the ſame is he which baptizeth with the Holy Spirit;</hi> and upon this account <hi>John</hi> preferred him before himſelfe, Mat. 3.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42649:39"/> 11. <hi>I indeed baptize you with water unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear, he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi> He plainly declared him to be a <hi>mighty one</hi> in this reſpect. This was that which he promiſed, and accordingly accompliſhed to, and upon his Diſciples, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and amazement of all, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2. from 1. to 13. <hi>verſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, His conference; he had many conferences with very acute and ſubtil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and he overcame them all, with the chief Prieſts and the Elders, <hi>Math.</hi> 21. <hi>They could not anſwer him,</hi> verſ. 27. with the Diſciples which the Phariſees ſent unto him with the <hi>Herodians,</hi> after they had taken council how they might intangle him in his talk; the iſſue was, when they had heard his anſwer to their ſubtil Queſtion, they marvelled and left him, and went their way, <hi>Matth:</hi> 22.22. The ſame day the Sadduces came and put a Queſtion to him, and when the multitude heard his anſwer, they were aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. The Phariſees hearing that he had put the Sadduces to ſilence, gathered together, and one of them which was a Lawyer, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him a queſtion, which he anſwered, and when the Phariſees were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42649:39"/> he asked them a queſtion, and no man was able to anſwer him a word, neither durſt any man (from that day forth) ask him any more queſtions, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. to the end of the <hi>Chap:</hi> The Ruler of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue fell upon him with great indignation becauſe of his healing on the Sabbath day, whom when he had anſwered, all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries were aſhamed, and all the people rejoyced for all the glorious things that were done by him, <hi>Luke</hi> 13, 15, <hi>ad</hi> 18. And conferring with the Lawyers and Phariſees about his healing on the Sabbath day; it is recorded, <hi>They held their peace, they could not anſwer him again to theſe things,</hi> Luke 14.4, 6. We may ſee alſo how mighty he was in his conferences with the <hi>Jews,</hi> John 8. and 10. Chapters; and alſo with the Devil, the ſubtilleſt enemy, whoſe ſeveral Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he anſwered by Scripture; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all was, <hi>The Devil leaveth him, and behold Angels came and miniſtred unto him, Mat.</hi> 4.1. <hi>ad</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> More need not be added to ſhew that he was mighty in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He was mighty in his works reſpecting the bodies of men, and others which will appear in ſeverall particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the nature and kind of them his works were not common, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42649:40"/> but ſpecial and extraordinary; and therefore it is ſaid, He did mighty works, wrought miracles and wonders among the people, works above, and beyond the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted order of Nature, and he wrought not only mighty works as they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the common works of others, but as they are diſtinguiſhed from the mighty works and miracles of others, therefore the people aſtoniſhed, cryed out, <hi>What wiſdome is this that is given him, that even ſuch mighty works are wrought by his hands?</hi> Mark. 6.2. He caſt out Devils; we never read of any before Chriſt, that caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, (though ſome other miracles they did) therefore when he caſt out a Devil, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes marvelled, ſaying, <hi>It was never ſo ſeen in Iſrael,</hi> Matth. 9.33. He opened the eyes of one born blind, and (as the man ſaid) <hi>Since the world began it was not heard, that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind,</hi> John 9.32. He healed ſuch diſeaſes as other Phyſitians could not, the woman that had the iſſue of blood twelve years, after ſhe had ſuffered many things of many Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and had ſpent all that ſhe had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worſe; ſhe did but come behind Jeſus and touch him, and ſtraightway the fountain of her blood was dryed up, and ſhe felt in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42649:40"/> that ſhe was healed of that plague, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.25, 26, 27, 28. When the Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick child, whom the Diſciples could not cure, was brought to Chriſt, he rebuked the Devil, and he departed out of him, and the child was cured from that very hour, Mat. 17, 15, 16, 18. He did among the people the works which none other did, <hi>John</hi> 15. 24. and he is a <hi>mighty One</hi> that can do that which others of great skill and power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the multitude of them, he did many mighty works, many miracles, others before wrought a few, <hi>Moſes</hi> a few, <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> a few by anothers power, but Chriſt wrought many, healed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſick perſons, all manner of ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and diſeaſes among the people. If I ſhould enumerate the miracles written which Jeſus did, they would appear to be many, and yet he did many more than are written, it is ſaid John 21.25. at the cloſe of the hiſtory of the life of Chriſt, <hi>There are alſo many other things which Jeſus did, the which if they ſhould be written, every one, I ſuppoſe that even the world it ſelf could not contain the Books that ſhould be written.</hi> Of thoſe things which are written that he did, moſt of them are wonders, or elſe have wonders in them (as I have in part, and ſhall further make to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42649:41"/> appear) Now if we count him a <hi>mighty one,</hi> that doth a few great things in his life time, now and then a wonder, how mighty muſt he needs be, whoſe miracles are more than all the other actions of his life? the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his miracles ſpeak him to be a <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty One,</hi> according to that of the people, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded concerning him, John 7.31. <hi>Many of the people believed on him, and ſaid; When Chriſt c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>meth, will he do more miracles than theſe which this man hath done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the variety of them, not a multitude of miracles of one kind, as to heal multitudes of one diſeaſe only, but he <hi>healed all manner of ſickneſs and all manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe among the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Diſeaſes, as blindneſs, withered<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lameneſs, fevers, dropſies.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Languiſhings, weakneſſes, conſumptions, diſeaſes which are not ſo painful, as waſteful of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Tortures, wracks, aches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, palſies, lunacy, painful diſeaſes; and he did not onely heal all diſeaſes, but he alſo raiſed the dead, caſt out Devils gave ſight to the blind, rebuked and ſtilled the winds, turned water into wine, walked on the Sea, fed thouſands with a few Loaves, and it cannot be ſaid of Chriſt, he was only exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llent and eminent in ſome one thing,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42649:41"/> but he was mighty in every thing; the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of his miracles is a very cleer demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his mightineſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the celerity and ſpeedineſs of them; he did them ſwiftly, ſuddenly, he healed diſeaſes immediately, when he bad them ariſe, they aroſe preſently; the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts have obſerved and recorded it, as that which adds glory to Chriſts miracles of healing, and other works, that he did them ſo quickly; many being <hi>healed the ſame Hour</hi> that he undertook their cure in, as is evident, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Math.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Math.</hi> 17.18. <hi>The blind immediately received ſight, the lame immediately roſe up and walked, the crooked were immedately made ſtraight, Devils came immediately out of thoſe that were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, he ſtilled the winds on a ſudden, he curſed the fig-tree, and it preſently withered away;</hi> yea, it is ſaid, <hi>In the ſame Hour he cured many of their infirmities, plagues, and of evil ſpirits, and unto many that were blind, he gave ſight,</hi> Luke 7.21. Chriſt did not take a week, month, or half a years time to heal in, (as others do and yet famous) but what he did, he did quickly, and how <hi>mighty</hi> an <hi>One</hi> muſt he needs be, who works miracles ſo ſpeedily?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In the facility of them, they were eaſie.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42649:42"/>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of the Agent, Chriſt himſelf, his mighty works were not hard nor grievous, but eaſie to him, he did them without pain, or toyl to himſelf, for he did ordinarily heal and work other miracles by ſpeaking a word or two, by touching of perſons, difficulties were not difficulties to him, but were his paſtime and pleaſure; for it was his delight, and his meat to do the will of him that ſent him; he is a <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty One</hi> who doth ſuch mighty things ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In reſpect of the ſubject upon whom he wrought any wonderfull works, when he healed others, he did not (as the manner of other eminent ones is) put them to great, nor yet to any pain in order to their cure, but forthwith freed them from their preſent pains, yea, their very healing was without pain, which ſets up his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe above mans.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, In his conſtant fitneſſe and readineſſe to do them, when ever he had any call, however he did ſeem to be diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with much buſineſſe, he was alwayes ready and prepared for the work he was called to; he never ſent any away uncured, unhealed, never excuſed himſelf, ſaying, <hi>I am now buſie, come ſome other time;</hi> he did not ſo much as make any delay to do for them,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42649:42"/> according to their deſire (only he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times took occaſion to try, and commend the faith of ſome) no time was untimous to him, when people came to him. After he had been teaching his Diſciples upon the Mount (without queſtion ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpace of time) when he was come down great multitudes followed him, &amp; he healed the Leper, the Centurians ſervant, and <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother, and having ſpent the day in working, when the Evening was come, they brought unto him many that were poſſeſſed with Devils, and he did not ſo much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it till the morning, but he then caſt out the ſpirits with his Word, and healed all that were ſick, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.16.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In the viſibility and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, many of his works being wrought before multitudes, he was not of a cowardly and fearfull ſpirit, he did not chooſe to work them in a corner, or in ſome private place (though he wrought ſome privately as he had occaſion) but openly in the chief publick places, in Cityes, as <hi>Corazin, Bethſaida,</hi> yea in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that great and famous City, in the Synagogues, and in the Temple, whether the <hi>Jews</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reſorted, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.14. In the preſence of the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.21, 25. Even when the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42649:43"/> were watching him, <hi>Looking round about them all, he ſaid unto the man which had the withered hand, Stretch out thy hand, and he did ſo, and his hand was reſtored whole as the other,</hi> Luke 6.6, 10. <hi>He oft healed and caſt out Devils in the preſence of the multitude, he turned water into wine publickly at a marriage feaſt in Cana of Galilee.</hi> And to this agreeth <hi>Peters</hi> deſcription of him to the <hi>Jews</hi> in his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.22. <hi>Ye men of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el hear theſe words, Jeſus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by Miracles, wonders, and ſignes, which God did by him in the midſt of you, as ye your ſelves alſo know.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eighthly, In the opportuneneſs and ſeaſonableneſs of them, being alwaies ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to occaſions offered, as may be ſeen in ſome inſtances; in the miracle of feeding five thouſand and more with five loaves and two fiſhes, it was when they were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, for they had continued with Chriſt three dayes, when they had nothing to eat, and when they were in the Wilderneſſe, and could not tell how to get any, and it was when it was evening, and the time to return paſt, then Chriſt works a miracle, <hi>Math.</hi> 14.15, 16, &amp;c. <hi>Math.</hi> 15.32, 33. <hi>He rebuked the winds and the ſea, it was when there was a great tempeſt in the ſea, inſomuch that the ſhip was covered with waves,</hi> yea, <hi>the waves
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42649:43"/> did beat into the ſhip, ſo that it was now full, and the Diſciples were in jeopardy, Math.</hi> 8.24. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.37. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.23. He raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> it was when ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid, <hi>Could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind, have cauſed that even this man ſhould not have dyed?</hi> and after <hi>Lazarus</hi> had been dead four dayes he turned water into wine, it was when they wanted wine, when the mother of Jeſus ſaid unto him, <hi>They have no wine,</hi> John 2.3.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, In the ſubjects of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the largeneſs &amp; unlimittedneſs of them; he wrought his miracles almoſt upon all ſorts and kinds of Creatures, as Devils, Men, Beaſts, Fiſhes, Sun, Earth, Aire, Water, Stones, Trees, as might be ſhewed, which plainly manifeſt that all Creatures were in his power. And Chriſt Jeſus was (if I may ſo ſay) indifferent upon what Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he wrought his miracles, whether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Man, Beaſt, or Devil, Sea, or Land, ſtrongeſt or weakeſt, it was all one to Chriſt, his power was not bound to this or that particular ſubject, but did extend it ſelf to all the Creatures, to the living as well as the dead; to the mightieſt, reſiſting, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Devils, as well as to the moſt feeble, fearful, and ſubmitting men and women.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In their unrulineſſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and towards others, as the Winds,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42649:44"/> the Seas yeelded to him, which made the men marvel, ſaying, <hi>What manner of man is this, that even the Wind and Sea obey him?</hi> Math. 8.27. Yea, Legions, many fierce unruly Devils ſubmitted themſelves to him, ſuch as no man could bind, no not with Chains, neither could any man tame; though they were unruly in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſpect of others, yet not unruly when Chriſt came to deal with them, which ſhews Chriſt to be a <hi>Mighty One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In their utter indiſpoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his works; he wrought his miracles of healing upon pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſons that had their diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a long time; he healed a woman that had an iſſue of blood twelve years; he healed another woman that had a ſpirit of infirmity eighteeen years; as alſo a man that had an infirmity thirty eight years; theſe by the long continuance of their diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were the more unfitted for healing; he gave ſight to a man that was born blind, greatly ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſpoſed to the receiving of fight; he cured a man that had Devils a long time, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.27. He raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he had been dead four dayes, altogether indiſpoſed to live again; and the greater indiſpoſition is in the ſubject unto the work, the greater is the power of the Agent that performeth it.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:42649:44"/>
               <p>Tenthly, In the perfection and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe of them, what he did, he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; <hi>The man ſick of the Palſie, aroſe, took up his Bed and went before them all, inſomuch that they were all amazed,</hi> Mark 2.12. <hi>As many as touched the hem of his garment were made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly whole,</hi> Math. 14.36. <hi>He rebuked the Winds and the Sea, and there was a great calm,</hi> Matth. 8.26. <hi>He reſtored the mans withered hand whole as the other,</hi> Matth. 12.13. <hi>He filled five thouſand men, beſides women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with five Loaves and two Fiſhes, and they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve Baskets full,</hi> Matth. 14.19, 20, 21. <hi>He healed the man that had an impediment in his ſpeech, and he ſpake plain,</hi> Mark 7.35. <hi>The woman that was bowed together was made ſtraight,</hi> Luke 13.13. <hi>He turned water not only into wine, but into good wine,</hi> John 2.10. The perfection of the work ſpeaks forth the might and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Agent.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, In the conſtancy of ſucceſs; he ever brought to paſs what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, he was no fooliſh builder who began, and was not able to finiſh: The hands of other m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ghty ones have not been able ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to perform their enterprize; the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſometimes could not cure the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but Chriſt healed all that were brought; we never heard of any thing too
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42649:45"/> hard for him, but whatſoever he did, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered; and indeed Chriſt never doubted of ſucceſs in his undertakings; he ſaith to the Leper crying to him, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt thou canſt make me clean, I will, be thou clean.</hi> Chriſt did not tell them that came to him, That he would do the beſt he could, or the like, but he forthwith healed them all; ſurely he is a <hi>Mighty One</hi> who is conſtantly ſucceſſeful in great undertakings.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, In the faith of thoſe upon whom, and for whoſe ſake he wrought his works, they did beleeve that he was able to do them for them, and ſo they magnified him by believing. <hi>If thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> ſaith the Leper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.2. <hi>But ſpeak the word only, and my ſervant ſhall be healed,</hi> ſaith the Centurion, at which Chriſt marvelled, ſaying, <hi>I have not found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael, Matth.</hi> 8.10.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42649:45"/> top of the houſe, ſo they brought the man ſick of the Palſie, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. <hi>When Jeſus ſaw their faith, he ſaid unto him, Man thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, In the time of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, it was the time of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he was in his loweſt eſtate, when he was (if I may ſo ſay) at the weakeſt; before he was glorified, he wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſome when he was apprehended, ſome when he was on the Croſſe, ſome when he died: when he was weake he was ſtrong, and if he were ſo Mighty in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement, in the day of ſmall Things? how mighty is he now he is in glory?</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, In his ſoleneſs, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs in the effecting of them, he did them by his own hand, and power, he did them alone, and of the people there was none with him to help him, and indeed he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the help of any man, for though they were great, and mighty works which he undertooke, yet his own Arme was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the performance of them; ſo mighty was he as to effect that alone, and of himſelfe, which others with all their helpers could not.</p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, In the meaneneſs of the meanes by which he wrought them, as by a word of his mouth, as God did his works
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42649:46"/> in the beginning ſo Chriſt did his; God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light; let there be a Firmament in the midſt of the waters, and there was ſo;</hi> ſo Chriſt to the ſicke, <hi>Take up thy bed, and walke,</hi> and he did ſo; he ſaid to the Seas <hi>be ſtill,</hi> and they were ſo: to the Devils, <hi>come out,</hi> and they came out; to the dead, <hi>come forth,</hi> and they came forth; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a touch of his hand, ſometime by the patients touching but the Hem of his Garment; he made the blind man to ſee by anointing his eyes with clay, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. And with ſuch like inconſiderable meanes he wrought wonders. The meanneſs of the meanes ſpeak forth the mightineſs of the Agent.</p>
               <p>Sixteenthly, In the Effects, in Generall, the good of them upon whom they were wrought; the miracles of ſome tended to the hurt of others, as thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon the <hi>Egyptians; Elijahs,</hi> 2 Kings 1. <hi>Peters,</hi> Acts 5. It is a very conſiderable difference between the miracles wrought by Chriſt, and thoſe wrought by others, that Chriſt never hurted, nor deſtroyed others by his workes; he came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them; And it is a greater thing to ſave than to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>More particularly; we finde that many marvelled; <hi>Many beleeved on him when they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42649:46"/> ſaw the miracles which he did,</hi> Joh. 2.23. When he had raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> many of the <hi>Jews</hi> which had ſeene the things which Jeſus did, <hi>Beleeved on him,</hi> Joh. 11.45. When Chriſt came into the Ship, and the winde ceaſed, they that were in the Ship, came and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him, ſaying, <hi>Of a Truth, thou art the Son of God,</hi> Math. 14.32, 33. So when the Centurion, and thoſe that were with him, watching Jeſus, ſaw the Earth-quake and thoſe things that were done, ſaid, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God,</hi> Math, 27.54. In a word, <hi>God was glorified,</hi> Math. 9.8. Math. 15.31. Luke 7.16. Luke 23.47. And Chriſt was <hi>glorified of all,</hi> Luke 4.15. And this was the End of God in ſending his Son to worke miracles, <hi>that his Son might be glorified;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words of Chriſt, when he heard that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſicke, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.4. <hi>This ſickneſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God:</hi> That the Son of God might be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified thereby.</p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, In his ſelf-deniall, and humility in his mightieſt workes; for the weake to be humble is not much as for the mighty to be humble, ſuch <hi>as heale all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, caſt out Devils, and do many wonderfull workes;</hi> to be humble in theſe things is to be mighty, ſuch are mightier in this, then in all the reſt of their mighty acts; ſome who
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42649:47"/> have been mighty to worke miracles, have not attained to be humble, and ſelf-denying in their greateſt performances; And herein was the excellency, and mightines of Chriſt to be ſeene, that he did more, and greater works than any, and yet was more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſelf denying than any; which doth further appeare.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that he did not ſeek his own honour and Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.50. When he had wrought a miracle, and the people would have taken him by force to have made him a King, <hi>he departed into a Mountaine himſelfe alone,</hi> Joh. 6.15. Yea he did rather obſcure, than ſeek his own Glory, in that he charged divers whom he healed, <hi>that they ſhould tell no man,</hi> Math. 8.4. Mark 7.36. Mark. 8.26. Luke 8.56. What ever other ends Chriſt might have in this prohibition, it plainly ſpeaks that he was not deſirous of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In that he ſought not his own profit, he did none of his mighty workes for money, he had no deſigne to enrich himſelfe by his workes, <hi>he ſought not Theirs, but them, he did not ask them, what they would give him, and he would heale them; he did not ſay for ſo much I will heale thee of thy Leproſie; for ſo much I will caſt out the uncleane Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt had an heart free from the deſire and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42649:47"/> love of money, and we never reade that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he received any from any man for any thing he did; This Mighty One was above gifts, and Rewards from men.</p>
               <p>Twentithly, Mighty in his Victories, he had many Adverſaries, and met with much oppoſition, yet he overcame All, ſo he ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo Overcame, and am ſet down with my Father on his Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Over the World, the world was an enemy to him, and hated him becauſe he did teſtifie of it, that the workes thereof are evil, and did all manner of evil againſt him, they would faine have deſtroyed him, that he might have been no more, and to that end they condemned, killed, and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and then they thought they had overcome him, but he was not deſtroyed, for he roſe againe, and now liveth, being ſet downe at the right hand of the throne of God, and ſo he became victorious over all their hatred, malice, and perſecution; ſo much he told his Diſciples to comfort them in their Tribulation in the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but be of good chear, I have overcome the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Over ſin, not his (for he was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42649:48"/> without ſin) but ours; ſin was an enemy to him, and came againſt him in its ſtrength, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law, <hi>for the ſtrength of ſin is the Law,</hi> and did condemne him, ſo that he died for our ſins, ſin did its worſt, but could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, for he endured, and overcame it, according to that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>For Chriſt hath once ſuffered for ſins, the Juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the fleſh, but Quickned by the Spirit;</hi> Sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was in the world, and reigned like a Mighty King over all unto Death; but Chriſt came, and caſt downe ſin from its Throne, and brought it into Captivity, yea by his death he overcame it; <hi>he put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelfe,</hi> Heb. 9.26. And as for ſin in reſpect of himſelfe, he kept it at a great diſtance from him, and would not let it come neere him; he ſtood like a Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty One farre above it, keeping it under; <hi>for the Law of his God was in his heart, and none of his ſteps did ſlide; he was holy, harmleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and ſeparate from Sinners,</hi> Heb. 7.26.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Over Death, that Mighty Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, by death he overcame Death, like a Mighty victorious one he brake through Death, <hi>it being not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it,</hi> Act. 2.24. <hi>And being raiſed from the Dead, dieth no more; Death hath no more Dominion over him,</hi> Rom. 6.9. So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42649:48"/> to what is prophecied of him, <hi>He hath ſwallowed up Death in Victory,</hi> ſo that now we may ſay, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory?</hi> 1 Cor. 15.54, 55.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Over the Devil, that Mighty One, whoſe principall aime, and deſigne was againſt Chriſt; <hi>But he overcame that Wicked one, and that through Death,</hi> Heb. 2.14. <hi>For as much as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelfe likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through Death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> yea he triumphed over him, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. ſpeaking before of his blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was againſt us, and nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to his Croſſe, ſaith, <hi>Having ſpoiled principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them Openly, triumphing over them in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, Chriſt is not onely Mighty in the victories which his right hand have gotten over theſe Mighty Lords, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſo many, but alſo in the victories which he will get over them hereafter, for theſe his enemies are up againe againſt him, and he will be victorious over them. The Pſalmiſt ſings of him prophetically, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.3, 4, 5. <hi>Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O moſt mighty; with thy glory and thy Majeſty; and in thy Majeſty ride proſperouſly, becauſe of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42649:49"/> truth, and meekneſs, and righteouſneſs, and thy right hand ſhall teach thee terrible things; Thine arrows are ſharp in the heart of the Kings ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; whereby the people fall under thee.</hi> And in this poſture <hi>John</hi> ſaw him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.2. <hi>And I ſaw, and behold a white horſe, and he that ſate on him had a bow, and a Crowne was given unto him, and he went forth Conquering, and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The world is up, and Chriſt will never leave till he hath overcome it, till he hath brought in the Generality of men, <hi>viz.</hi> Jews and Gentiles to be ſubject to him, to be one ſheepfold under him the Great Shepheard and Prince, whom the Lord hath ſet over them; according to the prophecies of him, <hi>Ezek</hi> 34. &amp; 37 Chapters, <hi>And as for his deadly enemies that will not that he ſhould reigne over them, he will ſlay them with the breath of his lips,</hi> Rev. 19. from the 11 <hi>verſe</hi> to the end, <hi>John</hi> ſaw him in a warring poſture with the Beaſt, and the Kings of the earth, and their Armies, which were gathered together to make warre againſt him, and the iſſue was, <hi>The Beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that wrought Miracles before him, theſe both were caſt alive into a Lake of fire burning with Brimſtone, and the Remnant were ſlaine with the ſword of him that ſate upon the horſe, which ſword proceeded out of his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:42649:49"/>
               <p>Sin is up againſt him, now he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Idolatry is up in the Nations of the world, Antichriſtianiſme is up, prophaneſs is up, ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs is up in the earth, and the Lord Chriſt will not ceaſe working till he hath rooted out ſin, till he hath deſtroyed all the workes of the Devil; And according to what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of him, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42.4. <hi>He ſhall not faile nor be diſcouraged, till he hath ſet Judgement in the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Devil is up alſo, and hath great wrath againſt him, and all his, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may for a time prevaile to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Nations, yet he ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in the end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9, 10. <hi>Fire came downe from God out of heaven, and devoured the Nations, and the Devil that deceived them was caſt into the Lake of fire and brimſtone, where the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet are, ſhall be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted day and night for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Mighty in his Offices, which are three, King, Prieſt, Prophet.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is a King, and that is an office which ſpeaks might and power; a King notes Supremacie in reſpect of others, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. but Chriſt is not onely a King, and mighty in that regard, but alſo a Mighty King, a King above all other Kings, he is a <hi>King higher than the Kings of the earth,</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42649:50"/> 89.27. <hi>The Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Rev. 1.5. <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</hi> Rev. 17.14. He is a mighty King.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In himſelfe, and that eſpecially in two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In majeſty, and glory, excellent majeſty is upon him; The Pſalmiſt ſinging of him, and his kingdome, ſaith, <hi>Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O moſt mighty, with thy glory, and thy majeſty, and in thy majeſty ride proſperouſly,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </hi> and beſtowed upon him ſuch Royall majeſty, as had not been on any King before him in <hi>Iſrael; yet behold a Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Solomon is here;</hi> for <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Glory was not arrayed like unto Chriſt; of this Glory the Apoſtles had a ſight, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the words of <hi>Peter, We were eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes of his Majeſty, for he received from God the Father, honour, and Glory, when there came ſuch a voice to him from the excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and this voice which came from Heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy Mount,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles him, even him that was crucified, <hi>The Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In wiſdome, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42649:50"/> he was and is greater, and above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, both men, and Angels in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; There was excellent Wiſdome found in <hi>Daniel,</hi> but there was more, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in Chriſt. God gave <hi>Solomon</hi> wiſdome and underſtanding, exceeding much, and largeneſs of heart, <hi>even as the ſand that is on the Sea-ſhore; and Solomons wiſdome excelled the wiſdome of all the children of the Eaſt Country, and all the wiſdome of Egypt; for he was wiſer than all men, and all the Earth ſought to him to heare his wiſdome which God had put in his heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.29, 30, 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.33. <hi>But behold a Greater than Solomon is here</hi> in this reſpect, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Even he in whom are hid all the Treaſures of wiſdome, and knowledge, Col.</hi> 2.3. <hi>The very wiſdome of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is Mighty in his Subjects; two things conſiderable in his Subjects which ſpeak forth his Mightineſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their Mightineſs, his Subjects are Saints, and Nations, and both ſorts are mighty, his Saints are excellent ones, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the higheſt ranke, they are Kings, and Prieſts, (being advanc'd to that Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by himſelfe) <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Men of other ſpirits, redeemed from among men, who have all Earthly things under their feet, ſuch as regard not Silver, nor yet delight in Gold, (The Law of the mouth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42649:51"/> of their King being better to them than thouſands of Gold, and Silver; as alſo men of valiant and couragious ſpirits for the honour of their King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, not loving their lives unto the Death,</hi> Rev. 12.11.</p>
               <p>The Nations of the Earth alſo are full of Mighty Ones, men of high degree, and all the Kings, Princes, Potentates, Rulers, chiefe Captaines, Great Lords, all the Mighty men of Valour, all the Worthies, and men of Renowne, and all the wiſe and Honourable ones of the Earth are his Subjects; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and mightineſs of the Subjects ſpeak forth the mightineſs of the King, how mighty muſt he needs be, who have all the mighty Kings and Princes of the world under him?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their multitude, he hath more Subjects than any, if <hi>Solomons</hi> Subjects were ſo great a people that could not be numbred, nor counted for multitude, how great and numerous, or rather innumerable are Chriſts Subjects, who are all people, Nations, and Languages, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14. And theſe are not onely his Subjects in reſpect of the Right, and extent of his Dominion, but alſo in reſpect of their ſubmiſſion and obedience to him, for all Dominions ſhall ſerve, and obey him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14, 27. Yea all kingdomes ſhall reſolve into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42649:51"/> The joyfull ſound of the Seaventh Angel, and the great voices in Heaven, which <hi>John</hi> heard, proclaimed the largeneſs and amplitude of the kingdome of this King, ſaying, <hi>The kingdomes of this World are become the kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reigne for ever, and ever; and if in the multitude of people is the Kings Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> Pro. 14.28. then ſurely he is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honourable one that hath ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes under him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is mighty in his Rule, and Adminiſtration, both towards his loyall Subjects, and deſperate Enemies; The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Chriſt towards his faithfull ones is chiefly in two things, in both which he appeares to be Mighty.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Preſervation; for he preſerveth the faithfull, even all them that love him: he is mighty to ſave, and defend them againſt all the mighty ones that riſe up againſt them, he hath been, and is a ſtrength to the poore, a ſtrength to the needy in diſtreſſe, a refuge from the ſtorme, a ſhaddow from the heate, when the blaſt of the terrible ones is as a ſtorme againſt the wall. The Pſalmiſt ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, and his kingdome, ſaith, <hi>He ſhall deliver the needy when he cryeth, the poore alſo, and him that hath no helper; he ſhall ſave the ſoules of the needy, he ſhall redeeme their ſoules
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42649:52"/> from deceit and violence,</hi> Pſal. 72.12, 13, 14. And for this reaſon the Prophet <hi>Zephany</hi> calls upon <hi>Zion</hi> to ſing and rejoyce; <hi>The King of Iſrael even the Lord, is in the midſt of thee, thou ſhalt not ſee evil any more; The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is Mighty, he will ſave,</hi> Zeph. 3.14, 15, 17. And this is the confidence of his Subjects, <hi>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, he will ſave us,</hi> Iſa. 33.22. And he is not onely mighty to ſave their bodies from deſtruction, but to ſave their ſoules from ſin, and death; for that was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which the Angel gave <hi>Joſeph</hi> before Chriſt was borne, why he ſhould be called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Math. 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus; for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins:</hi> And in this he is mightier than all other Kings, who cannot deliver any of their Subjects ſoules, none of them can by any meanes redeem their Subjects, nor yet their own ſoules, but ſtand in need of this Mighty One to ſave them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Remuneration; he is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous to forget the worke, and labour of love, which any of his Subjects do ſhew towards his Name, but will give reward unto his ſervants the Prophets, and to the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ints, and them that feare his Name, ſmall and great; and his Reward is great,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42649:52"/> becoming ſuch a Mighty King to beſtow, he will plentifully reward all his faithfull conſtant Followers, and his reward is.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Everlaſting life; This Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his ſelf-denying Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. <hi>My ſheep heare my voice,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and follow me, and I Give unto them eternall life, and they ſhall never periſh,</hi> Joh. 10.27, 28. And for this end his father gave him power over all fleſh, <hi>that he ſhould give eternall life to as many as he hath given him,</hi> Joh. 17.2. Eternall life is a rich reward, but heres not all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the righteous, they might have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life, though with trouble, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, and therefore he gives them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Everlaſting joy, and reſt, for though they have ſorrow and trouble here, and for a ſeaſon be in heavineſs through manifold Temptations, yet their ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy, <hi>into everlaſting joy,</hi> which none ſhall take from them; Their trouble ſhall be turned into reſt, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and aſſurance for ever; <hi>for the Lord Chriſt will recompence Tribulation to them that trouble his ſervants, and to them that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, reſt, when he ſhall be revealed from Heaven with all his mighty. Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.6, 7, 8. And that his reward may be full,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42649:53"/> together with everlaſting life, and reſt, he gives</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Everlaſting honour and glory, they ſhall not have life and peace in a low eſtate, but they ſhall be exalted to honour, they ſhall not reſt upon the Dunghil but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne; for this is his promiſe, <hi>Rev:</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſet with me in my Throne, even as I alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> Chriſt ſhall be King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they ſhall be next unto him; at that great day when all Nations ſhall be gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, he ſhall ſet the Sheep on his right hand, but the Goats on the left, <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay to them on the right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you from the foundation of the world, Mat.</hi> 25.32, 33, 34. His reward is a Kingdom, a Kingdome which cannot be moved, and thus Chriſt is a mighty King in his rule, and adminiſtration towards his ſervants.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt is mighty in his rule and adminiſtration towards his enemies, which doth principally conſiſt in two things both manifeſting his mightineſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Cohibition and reſtraint, for when his enemies come forth full of fury and rage, with full purpoſe of heart to deſtroy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42649:53"/> his people, he put his hook in their Noſe, and his Bridle in their Lips, ſo that they cannot act all the evil that is in their hearts, though they do exert and put forth ſome hatred and wrath, yet not all; <hi>For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of wrath he reſtraineth.</hi> So that no more of their malice, wrath, and cruelty do, or ſhall break forth, then what he ſees in his wiſdom and faithfulneſs to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and profitable for his ſervants to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; and this his adminiſtration do not extend only to the meaner ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the high and mighty to the Kings of the Earth, <hi>For he cuts off the Spirit of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that their hands cannot perform their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</hi> The Pſalmiſt ſpeaking of the beauty and glory of <hi>Sion,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lo, the Kings were aſſembled, they paſſed by together, they ſaw it, and ſo they marvelled, they were troubled and haſted away, fear took hold upon them there, and pain as of a woman in travel, Pſal.</hi> 48.4, 5, 6. The King of <hi>Sion</hi> took away their ſpirit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; yea, this extends to the very Devils, whom (when he was in the fleſh) he reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from hurting and tormenting, and it is becauſe of this part of the bleſſed rule and adminiſtration of Chriſt in Heaven, that men and Devils (whoſe hearts are fully ſet in them to do evil) have not torn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42649:54"/> the whole flock of Chriſt upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Deſtruction; for as his hand ſhall be known towards his ſervants, ſo his indignation towards his Enemies, whom he will deſtroy though never ſo many and mighty: The Pſalmiſt prophecying of him, and his adminiſtration towards his enemies, ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a Potters veſſel,</hi> Pſal. 2.9. And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſhall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips ſhall he ſlay the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 11.4. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That he ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God?</hi> &amp;c. Yea, the mightineſs and ſeverity of Chriſt in this reſpect is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſet forth by himſelf in the cloſe of the Parable of the Noble-man, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>But thoſe mine enemies which would not that I ſhould Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gn over them, bring hither and ſlay them before me.</hi> And the one and greateſt part of the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> do but acquaint us with the woes, plagues, and vials of wrath which he will poure forth upon his enemies, the ſum of all is, <hi>Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen; and the Beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe Prophet, theſe both were caſt alive into a lake of fire burning with Brimſtone,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42649:54"/> and the Remnant were ſlain with the ſword of him that ſate upon the Horſe, which ſword proceeded out of his mouth, and at laſt the Devil was caſt into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone where the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet are, and ſhall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented day and night for ever and ever,</hi> Rev: 18.2. &amp; 19, 20, 21. &amp; 20.10. So migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and terrible will Chriſt be in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his enemies; and thus he appears to be a mighty King.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt is a Mighty Prieſt, far above all other Prieſts, his mightineſſe is manifeſt in this reſpect, in ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the Dignity of his Perſon, which I conſider only with relation to his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, for the Apoſtle being about to treat of Chriſt as a Prieſt, firſt, ſets down the mightineſſe and excellency of his perſon, and the manner of his expreſſing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars (as <hi>who being the brightneſſe of his glory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and upholding all things by the word of his power</hi>) do plainly ſhew that they have relation to what follow, namely his Prieſt-hood, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle to give evidence of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency for that great function, doth firſt declare his power and greatneſſe, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his mightineſs afterward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a Prieſt he layes much of it on the Dignity of his perſon, <hi>Heb:</hi> 4.14. <hi>Seeing then that we have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42649:55"/> a great High Prieſt that is paſſed into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Jeſus the Son of God;</hi> he is a mighty Prieſt, in that he is the Son of God: The ſame Apoſtle magnifies Chriſt the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> above thoſe that the Law made, upon this account, <hi>Heb:</hi> 7.28. <hi>The Law maketh men High Prieſts which have infirmity, but the word of the Oath which was ſince the Law, maketh the Son.</hi> And he is the more excellent High Prieſt, in that it is the Son who is made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the peculiarity of his Title; he is not onely called an <hi>High Prieſt</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and once <hi>Heb:</hi> 10.21. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>A Great Prieſt,</hi> but he is alſo ſtiled <hi>A Great High Prieſt, Heb:</hi> 4.14. Though under the Law there was an High Prieſt, yet never was any called <hi>Great High Prieſt,</hi> but Chriſt, and though the Pope aſſume to himſelfe the Title of <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> the greateſt High Prieſt, yet it doth of right belong to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the perfection of his Nature, an High Prieſt without ſin, without infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, whereby he is by the Apoſtle diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from, and exalted above all other Prieſts, <hi>Heb:</hi> 7.26, 27, 28. <hi>Such an High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſſe, undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher than the Heavens, who needeth not daily, as thoſe High
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42649:55"/> Prieſts to offer up ſacrifice, firſt for his own ſins, then for the peoples; the Law maketh men High Prieſts which have infirmity, but the word of the Oath which was made ſince the Law, the Son, who is conſecrated for evermore.</hi> He is a merciful, faithful, tender, ſympathizing High Prieſt, <hi>Who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way, and is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb: 2.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the eminency of his order, he is a Prieſt not after that common way that others were, the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſo but ſuch an one as they, but after a ſpecial and more excellent order, peculiar to him alone, the order of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> that great and mighty man, King of <hi>Salem,</hi> unto whom even the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> (that Mighty One) gave the tenth of the ſpoil, even he that met <hi>Abraham</hi> returning from the ſlaughter of the Kings and bleſſed him, which ſpeaks him greater than our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> for as it is ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Without all contradiction the leſſe is bleſſed of the better:</hi> or more exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llent; this the Spirit of God (advancing Chriſt above all others) menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth both in that famous prophecy of his Kingdome and Power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.4. ſaying, <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec:</hi> As alſo ſix ſeveral times in the 5, 6, &amp;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42649:56"/> 7. Chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as it were delighting it ſelf in the rehearſal of the exaltation, and excellency of Chriſt in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In the ſolemnity of his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, different from the Ordination of other Prieſts, which was without ſo much ado, for they were made without an Oath, <hi>but he with an Oath, and that of God himſelf,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110 4. Minded alſo by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb:</hi> 7.21. <hi>The Lord ſware, and will not repent, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melcbiſedec;</hi> and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is ſome great and weighty matter which cauſeth the Moſt High to ſwear.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, In the performance of his work, which did conſiſt chiefly in four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To make ſatisfaction, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for the ſins of the people, and this Chriſt did, and he ſo did this marvellous work, as ſhewed his mightineſſe therein.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He did it to the uttermoſt, and that in reſpect</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of the nature and meaſure of it in it ſelfe, it was a full, perfect ſatisfaction, wanting nothing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. <hi>By one offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he hath perfected for ever them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified:</hi> So that there needs none of the works, nor ſufferings of any other to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42649:56"/> any thing to it; and if God at any time <hi>Viſit the tranſgreſſion of his children with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</hi> It is not in reference to any further ſatisfaction of his juſtice, but in order to their Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of the extent and largeneſs of it, as to the ſubjects that partake of this grace, and they are not a few, but many, <hi>For he gave his life a Ranſome for many,</hi> Math. 20.28. Mark 10.45. Not the <hi>Jews</hi> only, but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, he reconciled both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in one body by the Croſs, and came and preached peace to them that were afar off, and to them that were nigh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. And thus the world par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it according to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelfe;</hi> yea, <hi>The whole world,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world;</hi> yea, it extends unto <hi>All things,</hi> for ſo it is written, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And (having made peace through the blood of his Croſſe) by him to reconcile all things unto himſelf, By him,</hi> I ſay, <hi>whether they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He did at once, not by many, but by one offering, and this ſpeaks him a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> upon this very account the Apoſtle prefers him and his ſacrifice before
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42649:57"/> all the Levitical Prieſts and their ſacrifices, of their ſacrifices he ſaith, <hi>The Law can never with thoſe ſacrifices which they offered yeer by yeer, continually make the comers thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but in thoſe ſacrifices there is a Remembrance again made of ſins every yeer; for it is not poſſible that the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away ſin, Heb.</hi> 10.1, 3, 4. And again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>Every Prieſt ſtandeth daily miniſtring, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing oftentimes the ſame ſacrifices which can never take away ſin;</hi> but of Chriſt he ſpeaks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, not as of one weak, but mighty, a ſufficient Prieſt and Sacrifice; <hi>For by one Offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> He offered but one offering, and that was enough.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He did it in no ordinary way; not by killing of others, but by dying himſelf, by making and offering himſelf a ſacrifice for ſin, according to that in <hi>Heb:</hi> 9.26. <hi>Now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf?</hi> Other Prieſts to make attonement for ſins, offered other things in ſacrifice, he himſelf, he was the Prieſt and ſacrifice too; he the juſt, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God; this is wonderful, no more need to be added to manifeſt Chriſts mightineſs in the performance of this part of his Prieſtly work.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42649:57"/>
               <p>Secondly, To pray and intercede for the people, and this Chriſt doth, for he being come an High Prieſt of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, did not by the blood of Bulls and Goats, and Calves (as other Prieſts did but by his own blood) he entred in once into the holy place, into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us, <hi>Heb:</hi> 9.11, 12, 24. And this he doth to purpoſe, and with eminent ſucceſſe, obtaining eternal redemption for his faithful ones; for his blood being of ſuch great merit and vertue, and he having ſuch great intereſt and favour in Heaven, his prayers and interceſſions are very prevalent, as a Prince he hath power with God, (his Father always hearing him, <hi>John</hi> 11.42.) Neither is he ſo much a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner to beg bleſſings for Believers upon the account of meer mercy, but (having merited and purchaſed them by his blood) as a <hi>mighty Advocate he plead for them in a way of Juſtice.</hi> And upon this, the ſervants of God may, and do bear themſelves in caſe of ſin, according to that heart-unholding word, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. <hi>My little chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>n, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not, and if any man ſin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Christ the Righteous.</hi> Upon this did that good woman (that we read of in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory)
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42649:58"/> bear her ſelf, who (being charged and accuſed, and much put to it by the Devil) ſaid, <hi>Though I cannot anſwer thee, my Advocate can:</hi> meaning Chriſt. And the Apoſtle did apprehend ſo much of the mightineſſe of Chriſt in his performance of this part of his Prieſtly work, as that he layes the ſtreſs of his peoples eternal ſalvation upon it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To offer up the gifts and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the people, <hi>Heb:</hi> 5.1. &amp; 8.3. And this Chriſt doth alſo, and that powerfully and effectually, for he doth not take the prayers, praiſes, and ſpiritual ſervices of his people, and barely offer them up to the Lord, but by and through him preſenting them, they are acceptable to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. His very preſenting the perſons and performances of his people (unworthy and imperfect in themſelves) is ſufficient to make them acceptable to God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is mighty in that part alſo of the work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Prieſt.</p>

                  </gap>ly, To bleſſe the people, <hi>Numb:</hi> 6.23, 24, 25. This alſo Chriſt doth, and in this he is migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ier than all other Prieſts which were before him, which is evident in that</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:42649:58"/>
               <p>Firſt, He bleſſeth more than they; they bleſſed but a few in compariſon of thoſe he bleſſe, they but the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the moſt, they but one Nation, he all the Nations of the world, both the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, according to the promiſe of God of old to <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo often repeated, <hi>That all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed in him.</hi> And for this end did God ſend him according to the words of <hi>Peter</hi> to the <hi>Jewes Acts</hi> 3.25.26. <hi>Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made wite our Fathers, ſaying unto Abraham, and in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſſe you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians, That Christ hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for them, that the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.13, 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He bleſſeth with more and more choice bleſſings than any other Prieſt; he bleſſeth not onely with bodily, but with ſpiritual, and with all ſpirituall bleſſings, with bleſſings for this life, and all eſtates and conditions therein, and with bleſſings for the life to come.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:42649:59"/>
               <p>Thirdly, He bleſſeth more eminently than they; he doth not only wiſh bleſſed, but make bleſſed; he doth not only pray for a bleſſing for his people, but he doth authoritatively pronounce them bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In the unchangeableneſs and everlaſtingneſs of his Office, when the Lord made him a Prieſt, it was for ever; <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent; thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec.</hi> And by this alſo doth the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt Chriſt above all other Prieſts, <hi>Heb:</hi> 7.22, 23, 24. <hi>They truly were many Prieſts becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death, but this man becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſt-hood, wherefore he is able to ſave,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is a mighty Prophet; this plainly appears by the words of the Diſciples to himſelf, inquiring about the things which came to paſſe in thoſe dayes, <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> 24.19. which they ſaid to be, <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Jeſus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.</hi> His mightineſs in this reſpect is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In his Original; for though all other true Prophets be of Gods raiſing up, and ſending, yet he more eſpecially; it is peculiarly prophecyed of him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42649:59"/> 
                  <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from the midſt of thee.</hi> He is a Prophet of Gods ſpecial ſending, he ſent him in a more eminent way than he did others, he ſent him immediately from himſelfe; <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> exalting him above others, ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>We know thou art a teacher come from God.</hi> He came from God otherwiſe than other Prophets did; it is ſaid of him alone, <hi>That he came out from God, even from the boſome of the Father, where he was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In his Qualification; he came out from God, and he came through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed for the diſcharge of this Office, <hi>even with the whole mind of God,</hi> and with a ſufficiency of power to make it known; the Lord ſpeaking of him ſaith, Iſa: 42.1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles;</hi> and himſelf ſaith. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, he hath anointed me to preach good tydings unto the meek; he hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the captives,</hi> &amp;c. He was full of the Spirit, and of power by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In his Commiſſion, and his Commiſſion is anſwerable to his Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, God gave him largely of his Spirit, and he gave him a large Commiſſion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance

               <p>Fourthly, In his Execution and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this Office; his teaching was, and is with power and authority upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men wonderfully convincing of ſin and righteouſneſſe, he is a teacher that openeth both the Scriptures and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings too, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32, 45. He doth not only propound truth to men as others do, but he makes them ſtoop to it, which none elſe can do: his Miniſtration is with ſuch power and efficacy as that he puts the Law of God into the minds of his people, and write it in their hearts, and this is the ſole prerogative of him who is both King, Prieſt, and Prophet as hath been ſhewn.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In the Command of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, <hi>viz.</hi> to heare him; God at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, and his Command to the people was <hi>to heare them,</hi> but God hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son, that Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who is greater than all the Prophets which were before him (he being the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all their Teſtimony) and he hath commanded, that we ſhould <hi>heare him.</hi> This the Voice out of the cloud uttered, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; Heare ye him;</hi> yea, this is the ſpeciall and ſtrict command of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22.

                  <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren, like unto me, Him ſhall ye heare in all things, whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you;</hi> and not onely ſo, but the ſeverity of God is, and will be towards all thoſe that reject, and deſpiſe his words; <hi>for every ſoule that will not heare that Prophet ſhall be deſtroyed from among the people, Act.</hi> 3.23. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>See that ye refuſed not him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not, who refuſed him that ſpake on Earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turne away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven,</hi> Heb. 12.25. <hi>This is his commandement, that we ſhould beleeve on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23.

               <p>Twenty-ſecondly, In the Carriage of others towards him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the carriage of the generality of the people as</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their recourſe to him; we reade not that any of the Patriarchs, Judges,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42649:61"/> Kings, Prophets, or Apoſtles were ſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and flockt to as he was; As ſoone as he was borne, we reade of wiſe men who came a great journey, from the Eaſt to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to worſhip him; and as ſoone as he began to teach, and worke miracles, ſuch multitudes followed him, that he was fain to goe up into a Mountaine to teach his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.1. and as ſoone as he was come downe Great multitudes followed him, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.1. He was ſeldome without multitudes who attended to ſee his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and to heare his wiſdome, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words which proceeded out of his mouth; ſometimes there was ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitude of people gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they trod one upon another, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.1. When he was in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> in <hi>Simons</hi> houſe healing, all the City was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together at the doore; And riſing up early a great while before day, he went into a ſolitary place, &amp; <hi>Simon</hi> having found him, ſaid unto him, <hi>All men ſeek for thee, Mark.</hi> 1.33, 37. Sometimes he was ſo thong'd, that they could not bring the ſicke nigh unto him in an ordinary way, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his mother, nor brethren could come at him, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.19. When the Apoſtles ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themſelves together unto him, to give him an account of ſome matters, he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42649:62"/> called them into a deſart place to reſt a while, for there were many coming, and going, and they had no leiſure ſo much as to eate; And though they departed into a deſart place by Ship privately, the people ſaw them departing, and many knew him, and ran a foot thither out of all Cities, and out-went them, and came together unto him; And when he came into the Land of <hi>Geneſareth,</hi> &amp; came out of the Ship, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they knew him, and ran through that whole Region round about, and began to carry about in beds thoſe that were ſick, where they heard he was, and whither ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he entred, into Villages, or Cities, or Countries, they laid the ſick in the ſtreets, and beſought him that they might touch, if it were but the border of his garment, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.30, 31, 32, 33, 53, 54, 55, 56. This carriage of the people ſpeak him forth to be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, Their marvelling, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at his Doctrine, and Workes, and that not ſeldome, once or twice onely but often, they often marvelled, they often wondred, they were often amazed, they were often aſtoniſhed, as might be ſhewne, and as it was often in reſpect of time, ſo it was much, and great in reſpect of meaſure.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42649:62"/> It is ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.51. when Chriſt went up unto his Diſciples into the Ship, <hi>the winde ceaſed, and they were ſore amazed in themſelves beyond meaſure, and wondred;</hi> when the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which was dead aroſe and walked, they which beheld it were aſtoniſhed with a great aſtoniſhment, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.42. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, they were in an extaſie, in a great extaſie, they were not themſelves for the time; ſo when he healed the man which was deafe and dumbe, they that ſaw it were beyond meaſure aſtoniſhed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Their Rejoycings, and Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; <hi>As he did ride into Jeruſalem, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great multitude ſpread their garments in the way, others cut downe branches from the trees, and ſtrawed them in the way, and the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cryed, ſaying, Hoſanna to the Son of David, bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hoſanna in the higheſt,</hi> Math. 21.8, 9. So likewiſe when he had anſwered the Ruler of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, cavilling at him for healing on the Sabbath day, it is ſaid, <hi>All the people Rejoyced for all the Glorious things that were done by him, Luke</hi> 13.17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Their beſeechings, the great and mighty ones beſought him, <hi>Jairus one of the Rulers of the Synagogue, fell at his feet, and beſought him greatly to come and lay his

               <p>Fifthly, Their worſhipping; <hi>Many of thoſe that came to him, fell downe at his feet, and worſhipped him,</hi> the Ruler of the Synagogue, and others, both good and bad worſhipped him all along, In his Infancy, <hi>Math.</hi> 2.11. In his Man-age oft, After his Reſurtection, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.9. In the time of his Aſcenſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.52.

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Their perſecutions; for that he was ſo perſecuted of the Mighty Ones of the world, was becauſe they lookt upon him, as a Mighty One, and were afraid of him, leſt he ſhould become mightier then they, and indeed perſecution of any perſon or party, do uſually ariſe from feare in the perſecutors, leſt ſuch a perſon or party ſhould prevaile againſt them; It was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſo in the perſecutions of Chriſt, as

                  </gap>, very much terrified, and all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with him. It is alſo ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.18. <hi>The Scribes and the chiefe Prieſts ſought how they might deſtroy him, For they feared him, becauſe all the people were aſtoniſhed at his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> And when ſome told the Phariſees what things Jeſus had done, <hi>Then gathered the chiefe Prieſts and the Phariſees a Councel, and ſaid, what do we? for this man doth miracles; if we let him thus alone, all men will beleeve on him, and the Romanes ſhall come, and take away both our place, and Nation; and from that day forth they took councel together for to put him to death, Joh.</hi> 11.46, 47, 48, 53. And Hiſtory tells us of ſome Emperours, who have been ſo troubled with the Feare of one King <hi>Jeſus</hi> taking away their Crownes, as they have ſought the deſtruction of the whole lineage of <hi>David;</hi> ſo that it is apparent that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſecutions of his enemies ſpake him to be a Mighty One, one whom they durſt not let live.</p>

                  </gap>ſiaſticall, and military, as is evident in the words of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>Acts</hi> 4.25, 26, 27. <hi>Lord thou art God which haſt made Heave and Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who by the mouth of thy ſervant David haſt ſaid, Why did the Heathen rage, and the people imagine vaine things; The Kings of the Earth ſtood up, and the Rulers were gathered together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt. For of a truth againſt thy holy child Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Iſrael were gathered together; with</hi> Luke 19.47. <hi>The chiefe Prieſts, and the Scribes, and the chiefe of the people ſought to deſtroy him;</hi> thus all ſorts of Intereſts were ingaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Combination of all they have, which may be reduced to three heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A Combination of powers, and ſtrength; For both <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> and the chiefe Prieſts, and others joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their ſeverall powers, and Authorities againſt him; and as it was then, ſo it was to be afterwards, as is manifeſt by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels explanation of <hi>Johns</hi> Viſion to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12, 13, 14. <hi>The ten Hornes which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42649:64"/> thou ſaweſt are ten Kings which have received no kingdome as yet, but receive power as Kings one houre with the Beaſt; Theſe have one minde, and ſhall give their power and ſtrength unto the Beaſt; Theſe ſhall make warre with the Lambe:</hi> And this <hi>John</hi> ſaw yet more fully, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.19. <hi>I ſaw the Beaſt, and the Kings of the Earth, and their Armies gathered together to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that ſate on the Horſe, and againſt his Army;</hi> Thus the powers and forces of the world combine againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Combination of policy, and Councel; The Enemies of Chriſt <hi>conſulted together with one Conſent, and were confederate againſt him;</hi> They conſulted together how to intangle him in his talke, how to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, how to put him to death, how to conceale his Reſurrection, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.15. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.3, 4. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Math.</hi> 28.12. Of this the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>The Kings of the Earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,</hi> Pſal. 2.2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Combination of purſes, they had all one purſe againſt him; this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in his Apprehenſion, for the chiefe Prieſts and Captaines covenanted to give <hi>Judas</hi> money, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 4, 5. As alſo in his Reſurrection (being apparent to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who alſo declared it to the chiefe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42649:65"/> Prieſts) they ſpared no coſt to prevaile with the Souldiers to conceale the ſame; They gave <hi>large money</hi> to them to ſtop their mouths from publiſhing the Truth, and to open them to tell a lie, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Combination againſt him, and all of him; They combined againſt his perſon to put him to death as a Malefactor; againſt his Doctrine, to keep, or caſt it out as error; againſt his ſervants to root them out of the Earth, as evil doers; againſt his Kingdome, to ſuppreſſe that as ſome hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, dangerous thing; As their hatred was of the whole kind, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, and thoſe that were Chriſts, ſo they combined againſt him, and all of him, both perſons, and things, that the name of Chriſt might be no more in Remembrance. And that they durſt not deale with him ſingly, but thus combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together againſt him, is a plaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his mightineſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the carriage of his ſervants towards him, as</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their confidence in him; In all their difficulties, dangers, and diſtreſſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating both to ſoule and body, he is their confidence for ſupplyes, ſuccours, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; neither is he the confidence of ſome onely, but of all his ſervants, not of the <hi>Jews</hi> onely (for many, yea many thouſands of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42649:65"/> them have beleeved on him, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21.) but alſo, and eſpecially of the Gentiles; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prophecy of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.10. <hi>He ſhall ſtand for an Enſigne of the people, to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeeke;</hi> which the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, and calls a <hi>Truſting in him, Rom.</hi> 15.12. <hi>In him ſhall the Gentiles truſt;</hi> and thus he is the Confidence of all the ends of the Earth, and of them that are a far off upon the Sea, and how mighty muſt he needs be that is the ſole truſt, and confidence of all the truely wiſe, holy, and faithfull ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their Confeſſion of him; As the Lord requireth confeſſion with the mouth, as well as faith in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. ſo the ſervants of Chriſt are not ſatisfied that they beleeve on him onely (in ſecret) as their Prince, and Saviour, but by their profeſſion proclaime him to be ſo on the houſe-top (being neither aſhamed, nor afraid to confeſſe him before men) that others might alſo know, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him with them. And as Confeſſion of him is (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith) <hi>Virtus virtutum, et ſummum, ac difficillium opus,</hi> the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and difficult worke, and that which ſome beleeevers have not been able to do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42. So it attributes power to Chriſt, and ſpeakes him forth to be a Saviour, and a great One.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:42649:66"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Their ſufferings for him, which follow their confeſſion of him; how have they been reproached, perſecuted, and hated of all men for his Name ſake, <hi>They have had trials of cruel mockings, ſcourgings, of bonds, impriſonments, have been ſtoned, ſawen aſunder, ſlaine with the ſword, have wandred about in ſheep-skins, and goat-skins, in deſarts, mountaines, and in dens, and caves of the earth,</hi> Heb. 11.36, 38, 38. And not onely thoſe that firſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in Chriſt, but all the faithfull in their ſeverall Generations have been ready to be bound and to dye, yea many have died for Jeſus ſake: we reade not of ſuch ſufferers for any cauſe, either for number, conſtancy or cheerfulneſs, as the Martyrs of Jeſus, nor yet of any ſufferings greater than what they endured for Jeſus ſake; Surely he is ſome Mighty One for whoſe ſake ſuch an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Saints have ſuffered ſuch grievous things with joyfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Twenty-thirdly, He is Mighty in his own ſufferings, that he who was God ſhould ſuffer at all, was a marvellous thing, and a wonder, which was and could be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by aſſuming a nature to whom it was poſſible to ſuffer; his Mightineſs in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings is manifeſt.</p>

               <p>Secondly, In the ſubject of his ſufferings, he ſuffered in every part.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In his ſoule, as himſelfe ſaid, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.38. <hi>My ſoule is exceeding ſorrowfull, even unto death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In his body, in every part thereof, in all the ſenſes thereof.</p>
               <p>In his hearing, by their reproaches, and crying, <hi>crucifie him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his ſight, by their ſcoffing, and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing geſtures.</p>
               <p>In his ſmell, by his being in that noyſome place <hi>Golgotha,</hi> Math. 27.33.</p>
               <p>In his taſt, by his taſting of vinegar min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with gall, which they gave him to drinke, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.34.</p>
               <p>In his feeling, by the thornes on his head, blows on his cheekes, ſpittle on his face, the ſpeare in his ſide, and the nailes in his hands.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In his Name, by reproach, and ignominy.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In his eſtate, and goods, <hi>they crucified him, and parted his garments, caſting lots,</hi> Math. 27.35.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the meaſure of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it was good meaſure, heaped up, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42649:67"/> downe, and running over, he ſuffered a great deale of every kind.</p>
               <p>Much diſgrace, and ſhame; when he was teaching the Phariſees derided him, when he was diſcourſing the people ſaid, <hi>thou haſt a Devil.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>When they did condemne him, it was to be crucified, a ſhamefull death; and they preferred a murderer before him, when they had condemned him, <hi>they ſtripped him, and put on him a Scarlet robe, they put a Crowne of thornes upon his head, and a reed in his right hand, and they bowed the knee bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When they crucified him, it was between two theeves, eſteeming him the chiefe, and worſt of malefactors. <hi>And when he was on the Croſſe, they that paſſed by, reviled him, wagging their heads, ſaying, thou that deſtroyeſt the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and buildeſt it in three dayes, ſave thy ſelfe.

               <p>And when he was dead, they called him, <hi>that Deceiver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great poverty, as ſoone as he was borne,

               <p>Great paine; It is ſaid, <hi>Being in an Agony, he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were Great Drops of blood falling downe to the Ground,</hi> Luke 22.44.

               <p>Fourthly, In the efficient Cauſes of his ſufferings, both principall, and Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, he ſuffered from the Mighty.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From his Father, the Almighty God, he ſpared him not, it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to griefe, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From his foes, and they are Mighty Ones; he ſuffered from the Devil that Mighty One.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, From his Friends, from his own Countrymen, the <hi>Jewes,</hi> they would have him crucified, therefore ſaith <hi>Pilate</hi> to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.35. <hi>Thine own Nation, and the chiefe Prieſts have delivered thee unto me;</hi> yea from his neereſt friends, <hi>Peter</hi> ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed him; <hi>Judas</hi> his own ſervant, one of the Twelve, a Diſciple in Ordinary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him, and all his Diſciples forſooke him, and fled, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.56.</p>

               <p>Seventhly, In the end of his ſuffering; which was matter of greateſt weight and concernment, as the averting of Gods wrath the procuring of his favour, the freeing from all evil, and bringing ſouls to God for life and ſalvation; now how mighty an One muſt he needs be that endured ſuch a large meaſure of all kinds of ſufferings in all parts, from all ſorts of perſons? and that freely and willingly to procure mercy and favour for ſinners, and enemies to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

               <p>Firſt, His Apprehenſion and taking, they came forth as to a Mighty One that would not have been apprehended; <hi>Judas came, and with him a great multitude with ſwords and ſtaves, from the chief Prieſts, and the Scribes, and the Elders, Mark</hi> 14.43. And at that time
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42649:69"/> the mightineſs of Chriſt was ſeen, for when one that was about him ſmote the ſervant of the High Prieſt, and cut off his right ear, he did but touch his ear and healed him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.50, 51. And which is more they that went about to take him, were ſmitten down with one ſoft word of his mouth; for as ſoon as he had ſaid unto them, <hi>I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground,</hi> John 18.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, His Tryal; his Accuſation and charge was, <hi>That he was a perverter of the Nation, and forbad to give Tribute to Caeſar, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he himſelf is Chriſt, a King, Luke</hi> 23.2.

Art thou a King?</hi> his Charge was as of a Mighty One, and his Anſwer was as of a Mighty One: <hi>For when the High Priest asked him, and ſaid unto him; Art thou the Chriſt, the Son of the bleſſed? he ſaid, I am;</hi> that is, the Son of God, not by Adoption as others, but by Nature; for unleſſe this had been the meaning of his anſwer, they could not have condemned him of blaſphemy, but they took it as granted, nor did he deny it, that he made himſelf ſuch a Son of God, as was equall with God; ſo there was God ſtanding in the Congregation of the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42649:69"/> thoſe earthly gods did judge him, and he (which ſheweth that he was a Mighty One) judgeth them, or at leaſt declareth himſelf to be that Judge which was to judge them and all men too; for to that purpoſe was his Anſwer, <hi>Jeſus ſaid, I am, and ye ſhall ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> Mark 14.62. And when he was asked, <hi>Whether he was a King,</hi> he denyed it not, but confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it in theſe words, <hi>My Kingdome is not of this world,</hi> John 18.36,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Condemnation; he was condemned as a Mighty One, his Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the cauſe of his Condemnation was ſet up over his head, written, <hi>This is Jeſus the King of the Jews,</hi> Math. 27.37. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, <hi>The King of the Jews,</hi> Mark 15.26. <hi>Luke, This is the Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The main thing regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was, That he took upon him to be King of the <hi>Jews:</hi> And it is to be obſerved, that God did ſo over-rule the heart and hand of <hi>Pilate,</hi> that inſtead of noting ſome Crime, he ſets down a moſt glorious and worthy Title; and this Superſcription was wrought in three Languages, <hi>viz: Hebrew, Greek and Latine,</hi> The end of which was, (as Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42649:70"/> alſo the publiſhing of his Kingdome and Goſpel might ſpread all over the world, and <hi>Pilate</hi> would not be prevailed with by the chief Prieſts, to change the Title to that he ſaid, <hi>I am King of the Jews,</hi> but ſaid, <hi>What I have written, I have written,</hi> John 19.21, 22.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, His Death, in which his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe ſhines forth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the Concomitants of it; as the converſion of the Thief, the darkning of the Sun over all the Land, from the ſixt, to the ninth hour, the rending of the Vail of the Temple in twain, the Earth-quake, the rending of the Rocks, the opening of the Graves, the riſing of many bodyes of Saints which ſlept, the conviction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Centurion with his Souldiers, <hi>That he was the Son of God, ſome great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty One that fell that day,</hi> Math: 27.51, 52, 54. Mark 15.33.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the vertue and efficacy of it; which I ſhall briefly hint in three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is of a purchaſing vertue; for by and through it he purchaſed a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ople, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>And an inheritance for them,</hi> Epheſ. 1.7, 11. <hi>Which no cerruptible thing as Silver and Gold could obtain,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42649:70"/>
               <p>Secondly, It is of a pacifying vertue; <hi>For by it he hath made an Attonement, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for ſin,</hi> Rom: 5.10. Heb. 2.17. <hi>Which the blood of Bulls and Goats could never do,</hi> Heb: 10.4, 11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is of a purifying vertue; <hi>It purgeth the Conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God, Heb:</hi> 9.14. Yea, <hi>It cleanſeth from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1.7. <hi>which no Sope nor Nitre can effect,</hi> Jer. 2.22.</p>
               <p>Twenty-fourthly, He is mighty in his Burial; ſome degree of glory did break forth in Chriſts Burial, he had an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Burial; <hi>He made his Grave with the rich in his death,</hi> Iſa: 53.9. <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> not onely a good man and a juſt, but alſo an honourable Councellour, together with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Ruler of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who brought a mixture of Myrrh and Aloes, about an hundred pound weight, took the body of Jeſus and wound it in Linnen Cloaths with the Spices and laid it in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre hewen out of the Rock, a new Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre where never man was laid before; that which was wonderful in his Burial was, that they who were fearful to confeſſe him when living, were bold to own him when dead, and to be buried; for <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> who was a Diſciple, but ſecretly for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> John 19.38. yet went
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42649:71"/> in boldly unto <hi>Pilate</hi> and craved the body of Jeſus, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.43. And <hi>Nicodemus</hi> which at the firſt came to him by night, had cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to appear at his Burial, though he was condemned and crucified as a great Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; this the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> noteth, <hi>John</hi> 19.39.</p>
               <p>Twenty-fifthly, He is mighty in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; which doth appear in that</p>
               <p>Firſt, He roſe at all, and it is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing for the dead to riſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He roſe ſoon, he did not lye many yeers in the Grave, he did not as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who promiſed the <hi>Sarazins</hi> after eight hundred years to re-viſit them, but within three dayes, for he ſaid unto the <hi>Jews, Deſtroy this Temple</hi> (ſpeaking of the Temple of his body) <hi>and in three dayes I will raiſe it up,</hi> and accordingly he roſe the third day, which was as ſhort a time as might be, for had he not been dead ſome ſuch like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, ſome would not have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he was dead at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He roſe againſt utmoſt humane oppoſition, though his enemies did what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they could to hinder it; the chief Prieſts and the Phariſees make an Addreſs to <hi>Pilate</hi> about this, ſaying, <hi>Sir, We remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that that Deceiver ſaid while he was yet alive After three dayes I will riſe again; command
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42649:71"/> therefore that the Sepulchre be made ſure untill the third day:</hi> And <hi>Pilate</hi> anſwered their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, <hi>for he ſaid unto them, ye have a watch, go your way, make it as ſure as you can; ſo they went and made the Sepulchre ſure, ſealing the ſtone, and ſetting a watch,</hi> Math. 27.62, 63, 64, 65.66. Yet Chriſt roſe notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their great watch of Souldiers, and great ſtone which they rolled to the door of the Sepulchre; ſo that by his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead, he is declared to be the Son of God with power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. And that he hath ſatisfied the Juſtice of God, and diſcharged the debt which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to pay to the full, being taken from priſon, the Grave, in which the ſtrength of ſin, and Gods wrath did for a time as Cords hold him; and therefore the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims a mighty victory at Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54, 55, 56, 57. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed then Chriſt appeared victorious, his Reſurrection being the beginning of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation.</p>
               <p>Twenty-ſixthly, He is mighty in his Aſcenſion, not onely in that he aſcended on high, into heaven; upon which account the Apoſtle magnifies him, <hi>Heb:</hi> 4.14. <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have a Great High Prieſt that is paſſed inro the Heavens, Jeſus the Son of God;</hi> but he aſcended as a Mighty One; <hi>Bleſſing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42649:72"/> as he parted with them, and they worſhipping him,</hi> Luke 24.50, 51, 52. <hi>The Angels alſo apppeared and attended,</hi> Acts 1.10.</p>
               <p>Twenty-ſeventhly, He is mighty in his Seſſion; he is ſet down on the right hand of God. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of him as of a Mighty One in this reſpect, <hi>Heb:</hi> 8, 1. <hi>We have ſuch an High Prieſt, who is ſet on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens:</hi> And in this reſpect he is far above any of the Angels, for God never ſaid to any of the Angels, <hi>Sit on my right hand, Heb:</hi> 1.13. And thus he is far above all Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every name that is named, not onely in this world, but alſo in that which is to come, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20, 21. To which agreeth the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet 3.22. <hi>Who is gone into Heaven, and is on the right hand of God, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers, being made ſubject to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Twenty-eightly, He is mighty in his coming again, and that in three things eſpecially.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the ſigns of his coming, the Lord will give notice to the world of his coming, by ſtrange, terrible and dreadful ſignes, publick ſignes, ſuch as all ſhall ſee and obſerve, for there ſhall be ſigns in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42649:72"/> in the Earth, and in the Sea: <hi>The Sun ſhall be darkened, and the Moon ſhall not give her light, the Stars ſhall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens ſhall be ſhaken, the Sea and the waves ſhall roar, the Nations ſhall be diſtreſſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, mens hearts failing them for fear,</hi> &amp;c. Math. 24.29. with <hi>Luke</hi> 21.25, 26. <hi>And then ſhall they ſee the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In the manner of his coming; he ſhall not come then as he did at firſt, not as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, as a Sufferer, but as a Conquerour, and Deliverer from all ſin and puniſhment; he ſhall not come in meanneſſe and weakneſſe, but in Majeſty and Power, triumphing over Sin, Death and Devil; <hi>He ſhall come in glory, in his own glory, and in his Fathers, and of the holy Angels,</hi> Luke 9.26. <hi>He ſhall come with all his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s and Saints attending on him,</hi> Matth. 25.31. 1 Theſſ: 3.13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the end of his coming, <hi>viz:</hi> to ſhew his might and greatneſſe more than ever he did, to take his kingdome, and to reign before his Ancients &amp; all others glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, to judge the quick and the dead, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. Utterly to deſtroy wicked and ungodly men, according to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Theſſ: 1.7, 8. <hi>He ſhall be revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42649:73"/> vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eminently to ſave his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>For he was once offered to bear the ſins of many, and unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time, without ſin unto ſalvation,</hi> Heb: 9.28. <hi>Then ſhall he ſit on his own Throne, and all overcomers with him,</hi> Rev: 3.21.</p>
               <p>Thus have I demonſtrated the mightineſs of Chriſt in many particulars; I ſhall add a few more to ſhew the ſuper-excellency of this Mighty One, the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is mighty, and righteous; he is no Tyrant, ſhewing forth his mightineſſe in barbarous and unjuſt actions, like the worlds Mighty Ones, whoſe courſe is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally evill, and their force not right, <hi>Jerem:</hi> 23.10. <hi>He doth not by his might overthrow right, but he alwayes worketh, yea, he loveth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 45.7. Though he may in ſome great and ſtrange works go beſides the ordinary path and courſe of providence, yet he never goeth out of the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; the moſt terrible things which he will do, ſhall be in righteouſneſſe; true and righteous are, and ſhall be all his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>for a Scepter of Righteouſneſſe is the Scepter of his Kingdom,</hi> Heb: 1.8. And being thus cloathed with righteouſneſſe, he excels the Mighty Ones of the Earth.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:42649:73"/>
               <p>Secondly, He is mighty and mercifull: The mighty ones of the world are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cruel and fierce, but for one to be mighty and mercifull is rare; ſuch an one is Chriſt, might and mercy dwell together in him; he hath a mighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet a tender heart, and though he be well able to cut off his ſtrongeſt, ſtouteſt Adverſaries, yet he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive and receive them graciouſly. It is obſervable all the mighty works of Chriſt were merciful works, not wrought in malice and revenge, but in love and good will to men, not for their hurt, but for their good, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He went about doing good,</hi> Acts 10.38.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is mighty and meek, mild and humble, not like the Mighty Ones of this world, who are for the moſt part of proud and ſcornfull ſpirits, and of fierce countenances; but he is meek and lowly in heart, <hi>Math:</hi> 11.29. Yea, though he be very high and mighty, yet hath he reſpect to the lowly, and unto that man will this Mighty One look, that is poor, and of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirit, and trembleth at his word; yea, with him will he dwell that is of an humble ſpirit. It was the excellency of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he was mighty and yet meek, none on earth ſo meek as he in his day; but Chriſt is both mightier and meeker too. I ſhall conclude
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42649:74"/> this with that rarity and wonder which <hi>Zachary</hi> mentions, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Rejoyce great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, O daughter of Zion: Shout, O Daughter of Jeruſalem; behold, thy King cometh unto thee; he is juſt, and having ſalvation, lowly, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon an Aſſe, and upon a Colt the Foale of an Aſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, He is mighty and wiſe; ſome who are great in power, are not eminent in wiſdome; but Chriſt is great in wiſdome, as well as in ſtrength, and therefore he is ſaid to be by the Apoſtle, <hi>The Power of God, and the Wiſdome of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He is mighty and patient, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, and ſlow to anger; it is not ſo much for the mean and weak to be patient, as for the mighty, ſuch as are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge all wrongs done unto them, <hi>Poſſe, et nolle nobile;</hi> The Mighty Ones of the world are uſually haſty, ſoon angry, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet upon thoſe that offend them; but it is the glory and excellency of Chriſt, that he is great in power, and yet ſlow to anger, and bears long with ſinners and enemies; he doth (at this very day) with much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering endure the manifold indignities, contradictions and rebellions of ſinners againſt himſelf, in which reſpect he excels other Mighty Ones.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:42649:74"/>
               <p>Sixthly, He is Mighty and Allmighty; <hi>He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, The Lord which is, and which was, and which is to come, The Allmighty,</hi> Revel: 1.8. Other Mighty Ones can do great things, but he can do all things; others are potent, but he is the Lord God Omnipotent, <hi>Rev:</hi> 19.6. and ſo higher and greater than they.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, He is mighty, and alwayes mighty: Other Mighty Ones they faint, and their ſtrength faile them, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 40.30. they grow weary and weak, and ceaſe to be Mighty, at leaſt ſo mighty as they have been: <hi>I cannot do as I have done,</hi> is the voice of other Mighty Ones; but Chriſt the Lord, the <hi>Mighty One</hi> fainteth not, neither is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his ſtrength faileth not, he is as mighty as he was when God firſt put his Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as his ſtrength was then, ſo it is now, and ſo it ever ſhall be; <hi>He is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, Heb:</hi> 13.8. His Mediatorſhip was as powerfull before, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his exhibition in the fleſh, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he is ſaid to be a <hi>Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev: 13.8. and will be hereafter, even at the very laſt end of all things, as effectual as it is now, or hath been heretofore.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:42649:75"/>
               <p>Eighthly, He is mighty, and the onely <hi>Mighty One,</hi> he is mighty and none beſides him, (the Father alwayes excepted, who hath put all things under him;) power is Chriſts peculiar, he is <hi>Plenepotentiarius,</hi> the Proprietary of power, and the Diſtributer of it; others, who are called mighty, are not ſo, compared with him; for <hi>He is the one Lord over all, Zech:</hi> 14.9. and they his Subjects, who muſt bow down before him, either freely or unwillingly; and therefore he is called by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 6.15. <hi>The bleſſed and onely Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. He is the <hi>Mighty One,</hi> that is truly that, and doth that, which other Mighty Ones are ſaid to be, and are not, and do not; that which is falſely aſcribed to others, is truly attributed to him; for though the worlds mighty ones are accounted mightier than indeed they are, this <hi>Mighty One</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eſteemed mightier than indeed he is. Hiſtory tell us, that <hi>Canutus</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> being flattered by his Subjects, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>King of Kings, Moſt mighty,</hi> &amp;c. went and ſate down by the Sea-ſide, commanded the floods ariſing and coming nigh him, nor to touch him nor his cloaths, but the floods came and made him ſtart back, and he ſaid to his Lords, <hi>Lo, ye call me ſuch a mighty King,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42649:75"/> yet I cannot cauſe this little water to ſtay at my command, but it is ready to drown me;</hi> but Chriſt can do this, <hi>(The Sea, and the winds obey him)</hi> and whatſoever any of the mighty ones of the earth undertake to do, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accompliſh: He is not onely called <hi>Mighty,</hi> but he is mighty and acts mightily; <hi>He is</hi> (without any flattery, or Hyperbole) <hi>Moſt High, moſt Mighty, moſt Sacred, moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; yea, He is Excellency, Highneſs, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Mightineſs, and Majeſty it ſelfe.</hi> Thus Chriſt doth not onely appear to be mighty, but to be mightier, and more excellent than all others; we have heard and read of many mighty, famous Ones, both in Sacred and Common writings, as <hi>Nimrod, Pharaoh, Moſes, Joſhua, Gideon, Sampſon, David, Solomon,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great.</note> and others, who have done great and mighty things, but Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels them all, and is greater than any, than all of them; indeed he is ſo mighty, that he is above the underſtanding of men, he is great in power, and we know him not, we cannot find him out, great things doth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
               <p>Queſt: <hi>How came Chriſt to be ſuch a Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty One?</hi>

In which reſpect God is ſaid to do what he did, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the words of <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame ſpeech to the men of <hi>Iſrael, Jeſus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles, wonders and ſigns, which God did by him in the midſt of you,</hi> Acts 2.22. And thus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Mighty through the Father.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Through the Fathers miſſion; the Father ſent him, and that's his ſtrength, and therefore he ſpeaks much of it upon all occaſions, nigh forty times in <hi>John,</hi> beſides ſeveral other places, he hints that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent him, and that he came not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but proceeded forth, and came from God; God cannot ſay of Chriſt, as of thoſe Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42649:76"/> not, neither have I commanded them: and as they were weak and could not profit the people, being not ſent of God,</hi> Chriſt being ſent of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes mighty to accompliſh whatever he undertook: Had not God ſent him, he could not have ſpake with ſuch Power and Authority, could not have done ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works, nor have undergone and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch grievous torments as he did; but being ſent of the Father, and knowing that the Father ſent him, he was full of might, courage, and confidence to do and ſuffer what was the Will of his Father that ſent him. Gods miſſion makes mighty, it was that which enabled <hi>Gideon</hi> to be a Saviour to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Judges 6.14. <hi>The Lord looked upon him, and ſaid, Go in this thy might, and thou ſhalt ſave Iſrael from the hand of the Midianites: have not I ſent thee?</hi> He that is ſent with full Authority and Power from ſome mighty Prince to tranſact his affairs, is thereby mighty, coming and acting as one ſent by him; Chriſt came and acted as one ſent from the abſolute Monarch of all the world, the moſt high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:42649:77"/>
               <p>Secondly, Through the Fathers Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he was full of power and might by the Spirit of the Lord; the Anointing of the Lord makes mighty, It was that which made <hi>David, Solomon, Cyrus,</hi> and others migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do the worke of God in their ſeverall generations, and it is that which makes Chriſt ſo Mighty, for being anointed with the holy Spirit above others, he became mightier than all others; The Lord anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him King, in which reſpect he is in a peculiar manner called <hi>Gods Anointed,</hi> Pſal. 2.2. and thence it is that he is ſo mighty to rule, both able to ſave and to deſtroy; The Lord anointed him to preach good tidings unto the meeke, and ſent him to binde up the broken-hearted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. with <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. and thence it was that his words were with ſuch power, and efficacy; And the Lord anointed him Prieſt, and ſo he was Mighty to offer up himſelfe without ſpot to God, and his blood alſo Mighty, and effectuall to purge the Conſcience from dead workes; according to the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit offered himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your Conſcience from dead workes to ſerve the living God.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> in his Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38. gives this very account of Chriſts might,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42649:77"/> and mighty workes, <hi>viz. That God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the holy Ghoſt, and with power,</hi> who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, for God was with him: And himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.29. <hi>He that ſent me is with me, the Father hath not left me alone.</hi> And thus through the Spirit of the Lord reſting upon him, even the Spirit of might (according to what was propheſied of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2.) he is Mighty.</p>

               <head>Reaſons why Chriſt is a Mighty One.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. For the Fathers Glory, that the Father might be glorified in the Son; for as it had been a diſparagement and diſhonour unto God to have ſent a weake, inſufficient one, ſo it is the Fathers glory that he hath ſent a Mighty One, one like unto himſelfe, <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt all them that come unto God by him,</hi> Heb. 7.25. It is the Fathers glory to have ſuch a Son, ſo Mighty a one, and that not onely becauſe he himſelfe did glorifie him on earth, but becauſe others alſo did glorifie him becauſe of his Son; for when the people, even the multitude ſaw the mighty works, and miracles which he did, they marvelled, and glorified God, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Math.</hi> 15.31. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.26.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:42649:78"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. For the Sons glory, that Chriſt might be honoured as well as the Father; Chriſt himſelfe gives this reaſon why the Father made him ſuch a Mighty One, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>The Father Judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgement unto the Son, That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father;</hi> and by this the Father drawes the thoughts and hearts of men to the Son, ſo as they receive and entertaine him as the Redeemer of the world; For Chriſt being a Mighty one, and ſufficiently manifeſting and evidencing himſelfe to be The Chriſt, the Son of the Bleſſed, by doing the Works which none other man did, neither could do, many beleeved on him, and became followers, and honourers of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe of the worke which God hath ſent him to do, which was hard worke, beyond the skil and ſtrength of men and Angels to performe, for it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme a weake, captivated, curſed people from the power of Sin, World, Death, and Devil, (thoſe mighty Adverſaries) and to raiſe them up unto a participation of his holineſs, and glory. It is Requiſite there ſhould be a proportion of ſtrength in every Agent to the work which he hath to do, that if the worke be difficult, the Agent ſhould be ſtrong; And it hath been the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42649:78"/> way of the moſt wiſe God to ſuite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to things, who though he hath, and doth ſometimes make uſe of weak ones for Great, and weighty, and difficult ſervices, yet doth alwayes make them mighty, and ſufficient for the work whereunto he calls them; he did ſo with <hi>Gideon, David,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And thus it was, and is with Chriſt, for being ſent to ſave, he was and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mighty to ſave; being ſent to redeeme, he is a ſtrong Redeemer, that he may thoughly plead his peoples Cauſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and confound all their enemies. The Spirit of God in the Prophets ſpeaking of the great work of Chriſt, in the execution of his Regal and Prophetical Offices, makes mention of his mightineſs and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereunto, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 4. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, I have put my Spirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth Judgement to the Gentiles. He ſhall not faile, nor be diſcouraged, till he hath ſet Judgement in the Earth, Micah</hi> ſpeaking of him as the Ruler in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſhall ſtand, and feed in the ſtrength of the Lord, in the Majeſty of the Name of the Lord his God, and they ſhall abide; for now he ſhall be great unto the ends of the Earth,</hi> Mic. 5.4. The Apoſtle alſo treating of his Prieſtly Office, ſaith, <hi>That he through the Eternal Spirit offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe without ſpot to God,</hi> Heb. 9.14.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:42649:79"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whence is it that men deſpiſe and oppoſe this Mighty One?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is through that Enmity which is in their hearts againſt him. God hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. put Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the Serpent, and the Woman, and their ſeed; and from this Enmity as from a curſed root proceeds that evil fruit of oppoſition againſt Chriſt, which will not ceaſe, till the Enmity be aboliſhed; This very account doth Chriſt himſelfe give of his enemies oppoſition againſt him, in one of his parables, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14. <hi>His Citizens ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and ſent a Meſſage after him, ſaying, we will not have this man to reigne over us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is through the ignorance that is in them, not knowing him whom they perſecute; It was ſo with <hi>Paul,</hi> when Chriſt ſpake to him, ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? He ſaid, who art thou Lord? and the Lord ſaid, I am Jeſus;</hi> he knew not Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4, 5. And thence it is that he ſaith (ſpeaking of his being a perſecuter and injurious) <hi>I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly in unbeliefe,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. From hence it was, even from their ignorance, that the Princes of this World did ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and perſecute him in his Perſon, they knew not the <hi>wiſdome of God,</hi> for <hi>had they knowne it,</hi> they <hi>would not have crucified the Lord
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42649:79"/> of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.7, 8. And himſelfe gives the ſame reaſon of his ſuffering, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in his Members, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2, 3. He ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues, yea the time cometh that whoſoever killeth you, will thinke he doth God ſervice; and theſe things will they do unto you, becauſe they have not knowne the Father nor me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Through <hi>unbeliefe;</hi> for though they heare of his Mightineſs, and power, yet they do not <hi>beleeve</hi> the <hi>report</hi> thereof, (though not one halfe of the greatneſs and power of Chriſt have been told them) but the words of them that declare it, ſeeme to them as <hi>Idle tale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> and they <hi>beleeve</hi> them <hi>not;</hi> and then no wonder they deſpiſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him: They do not beleeve his <hi>Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie,</hi> but ſay concerning their actions, <hi>How doth he know? can he judge through the darke cloud?</hi> Job 22.13. and ſo they become bold to ſpeak and act againſt this <hi>Mighty One;</hi> like thoſe whom the Prophet complained of to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.5, 6, 7. <hi>They breake in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thy heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; they ſlay the widdow, and the ſtranger, and murther the Fatherleſs; yet they ſay, The Lord ſhall not ſee, neither ſhall the God of Jacob re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it.</hi> Or if they do beleeve that he is <hi>Mighty,</hi> yet they do not beleeve that he will be ſo ſevere, and <hi>terrible</hi> to his enemies,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42649:80"/> as many conceive, and ſpeake, giving no heed to what is written concerning him, eſpecially <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.4. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. Thus, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluding in their own ſpirits, that there is no great danger in oppoſing him, they readily venture thereupon to their own deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Through <hi>confidence in their own ſtrength,</hi> thinking of themſelves more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than they ought to thinke, they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth to undertake more than they are able to performe. The <hi>Mighty Ones</hi> of the Earth do conceit, &amp; conclude within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they have a ſufficiency of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and ſtrength, to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>nter with this <hi>Mighty One. Pharaoh</hi> that <hi>mighty one</hi> was ſo confident in his own ſtrength, that he ſcorn'd, and oppoſed the <hi>Almighty;</hi> for he ſaid, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his voice, to let Iſrael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Iſrael go,</hi> Exod. 5.2. Likewiſe <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> truſting to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of his Chariots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſent a challenge to the <hi>living God,</hi> exalted, and lifted up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on high, even againſt the <hi>holy One</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 36.18, 19, 20. Chap. 37.23. When men are confident to overcome, they are bold to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Through their <hi>putting afarre off
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42649:80"/> the day of his wrath, and vengeance;</hi> they take boldneſs to rebell againſt him: And though they heare of his Indignation, and furious rebukes to be poured out upon them, yet they ſee that through his patience, &amp; long-ſuffering, there is reſpite; and ſo like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> they <hi>harden</hi> their hearts againſt him; they ſay, as they, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.22. <hi>The dayes are prolonged, and every viſion faileth; and becauſe ſentence againſt themſelves,</hi> and other <hi>evil wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers is not executed ſpeedily,</hi> in ſtead of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto him againſt whom they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r hearts are fully ſet in them to do more evil,</hi> Eccl: 8.11. and at length become <hi>mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and ſcoffers at him, and his word, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Where is this Mighty one? <hi>where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> where is his kingdome, and power, and glory? and thus become abuſers, and perſecutors of his ſervants up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Becauſe <hi>they are afraid he will take away their deare enjoyments from them, their power, pompe, pleaſures, profits:</hi> If Chriſt would be with them as a <hi>ſojourner,</hi> and ſtranger, and not meddle with their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they would let him alone; but they feare he will be a <hi>Prince,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Judge</hi> amongſt them, and drive them from their ſtations, and pull them downe from their ſtate, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.19. and therefore they thinke it wiſdome
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42649:81"/> to oppoſe him betimes. When <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and required that <hi>the Image of Chriſt might be ſet up in the Capitol;</hi> They returned <hi>Anſwer,</hi> that <hi>if that were ſet up, all the other Images of their Gods muſt downe. Poteſtas Chriſti non eſt priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva, ſed cumulativa, The power of Chriſt doth not deprive men of any good, but conferrs, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies bleſſings</hi> upon the heads of all thoſe that ſubmit to it, It being the readieſt way for Kings, Princes, and Potentates of the world to reigne long, and ſafe, to ſet <hi>their</hi> Thrones beneath the Throne of this <hi>Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty One,</hi> whom God hath made and exalted Lord over all. But for as much as the high and honourable ones of the earth are afraid he ſhould bring them into contempt, and ſhame, they deſperately oppoſe this <hi>Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, Becauſe of <hi>the preſent ſeeming meanneſs, &amp; contemptibleneſs of this Mighty One.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeakes of him as one <hi>deſpiſed and rejected,</hi> upon this account, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2, 3. <hi>He hath no forme nor comelineſs; and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him: he is deſpiſed, and rejected of men.</hi> Though <hi>Chriſt's</hi> doctrine and works among his own <hi>Countrymen,</hi> were even to <hi>aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> yet becauſe he had ſuch a <hi>meane</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, a meane trade and kindred, <hi>he was

I and my Father are one,</hi> Joh. 10.28, 29, 30. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſpeaking of their <hi>ſafe</hi> and bleſſed eſtate, ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> Though there be many indictments, and <hi>accuſations</hi> brought in againſt them, yet <hi>no condemnation;</hi> but being in him, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, they are free, and ſafe, and feare no evil: Hence the bleſſed Apoſtle ſends a challenge to all the enemies of Gods Elect, ſaying, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth; Who is he that condemneth?

                        </gap>hty</hi> in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, it is inexcuſable. The <hi>men</hi> of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> who <hi>repented</hi> at the preaching of <hi>Jonas;</hi> and the <hi>Queene</hi> of the <hi>South,</hi> who <hi>came from the uttermoſt parts of the Earth to heare the wiſdome of Solomon, ſhall riſe up in the Judgement with ſuch, and condemne them, ſeeing a Greater than</hi> Jonah <hi>and</hi> Solomon <hi>is with them.</hi> The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt <hi>John</hi> mentioneth the <hi>wonderfull</hi> workes which Chriſt did among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as the <hi>Aggravation</hi> of their <hi>unbeliefe,</hi> Joh. 12.37. <hi>Though he had done ſo many miracles before them, yet they beleeved not on him;</hi> Thence Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pbraid the Cities wherein moſt of his mighty workes were done,</hi> becauſe they <hi>repented</hi> not, it being a greater evil in them not to repent, than in others amongſt whom Chriſt did not ſhew himſelfe ſo mighty. To heare, and not to beleeve on Chriſt, the Mighty Lord, who <hi>ſpeakes from heaven,</hi> is that which makes unbeliefe to be ſuch a mighty ſinne, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It <hi>diſcovers a ground for the Saints Expectation of great things;</hi> The Saints are in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42649:83"/> expectation of <hi>perfect Redemption,</hi> and moſt <hi>glorious ſalvation</hi> to be wrought for them by Chriſt; and there is good ground for it; for beſides the <hi>promiſe</hi> of God, who is faithfull, here is the <hi>Ability</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>Mighty</hi> to performe the Fathers will. <hi>Great ones</hi> uſe to be <hi>active.</hi> The Mighty Kings and Princes of the Earth do not alwayes ſit ſtill, only waite for opportunities for great and weighty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. This <hi>Mighty One,</hi> the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> though he hath done <hi>great</hi> and <hi>marvellous</hi> things, will ſhew himſelfe yet <hi>more glorious</hi> than ever; for he hath yet but begun to ſhew his ſervants his Greatneſs, and his Mighty hand; onely he waites till the ſet time be come, and then he will <hi>ariſe,</hi> and <hi>redeeme Iſrael from all his iniquities</hi> and troubles, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.8.)</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples of Chriſt, who ſaw his might and power in the dayes of his fleſh, became expectants of great things to be done by him; <hi>We truſted,</hi> ſaid the two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, (ſpeaking of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet mighty in deed and word) <hi>that it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael,</hi> Luke 24.19.21. The Apoſtles (when Chriſt was aſſembled together with them,) asked of him, ſaying, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore againe the kingdome to Iſrael,</hi> Acts 1.4, 6. His <hi>Anſwer</hi> was no check to their <hi>expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:42649:84"/> but a reprehenſion of their over-curious <hi>affectation,</hi> to acquaint themſelves with the <hi>particular time,</hi> in which they ſhould behold the glorious accompliſhment of ſo certaine a bleſſing. And ſeeing this <hi>Mighty One is ſet on the right hand of the throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens,</hi> (Heb: 8.1.) his ſervants may expect, that he will appeare in the preſence of God for them; yea that <hi>he ſhall appeare the ſecond time without ſin, unto their evident and everlaſting ſalvation,</hi> (Heb: 9.28.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe and other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full followers of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven, from whence alſo we looke for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, For the <hi>diſcovery of falſe Chriſts;</hi> The true Lord Chriſt hath told us that in the <hi>laſt dayes</hi> there ſhall <hi>ariſe falſe Chriſts,</hi> as well as falſe Prophets, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.24. And <hi>this doctrine</hi> doth <hi>informe</hi> us <hi>how to know them from the true;</hi> The <hi>true</hi> Chriſt is thus <hi>mighty;</hi> and it follows that others, who are <hi>not</hi> ſo <hi>mighty,</hi> whatſoever they may pretend, are not the true Chriſt. Therefore when <hi>falſe Chriſts</hi> ſhall ariſe, and ſhall come, and ſay, <hi>I am Chriſt,</hi> beleeve them not, neither go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42649:84"/> them; but labour to know <hi>their power,</hi> and not their <hi>ſpeech</hi> onely, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.19.) (for the kingdome of God is not in word but in power, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20:) whether they be <hi>mighty,</hi> as the <hi>true</hi> Chriſt is. And though they ſhould ſhew <hi>ſignes</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, try whether they be equall with <hi>this Mighty One,</hi> who thought it no robbery to be equall with God. For though ſome may boaſt themſelves, and their <hi>mouths</hi> ſpeak <hi>great ſwelling words of vanity,</hi> yet their deficiency and inſufficiency for ſuch things as he did, ſpeak them to be <hi>falſe Chriſts,</hi> and deceivers. As there never did heretofore, ſo there never will any one ariſe in every reſpect, ſo <hi>mighty</hi> as Chriſt, by which he may be knowne to be the <hi>true</hi> Chriſt, from all others.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42649:85"/> deliciouſly, he was not in form and faſhion like the mighty ones of the earth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they expect and look for another that is <hi>Mightier</hi> than he. Seeing this is the ſtone they ſtumble at, how eaſily might it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, if they did conſider him from firſt to laſt? and in every reſpect he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them <hi>ſo mighty</hi> as they would not look for another, but know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be their Prince and Saviour; And indeed, the <hi>works</hi> of Chriſt did declare him to be the <hi>Meſſiah. John</hi> hearing of his works ſent two of his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for another?</hi> Chriſt ſends an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to convince them; and the <hi>Argument</hi> he uſeth is a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of his <hi>mighty works</hi> (being ſuch <hi>works</hi> as are <hi>proper to the Meſſiah</hi>) viz: <hi>The blind receive their ſight, and the lame walke, the Lepers are cleanſed, and the deaf heare, the dead are raiſed up, and the poor have the Goſpel preached to them, Math.</hi> 11.2, 3.4, 5. With this Argument Chriſt proved himſelf <hi>ſent of God,</hi> in his ſpeech to the <hi>Jews, John</hi> 5.36. <hi>The works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame works that I do, bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> And by this the people were convinced, <hi>John</hi> 6.14. <hi>Then theſe men when they had ſeen the miracle that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus did, ſaid, This is of a truth that Prophet that ſhould come into the world.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, And <hi>by STRENGTH ſhall no man prevaile,</hi> 1 Sam: 2.9. <hi>He is mighty in ſtrength; who hath hardened himſelfe againſt him, and proſpered?</hi> he will lead Princes away ſpoiled, and overthrow the Mighty, yea the Couragious among the Mighty ſhall flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way naked in the day that he ariſeth. You that are ſtrong, have you an Arme like him? or can you thunder with a voice like him? Know, that it is altogether in vaine to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> your ſelves againſt Chriſt, for by reaſon of his <hi>Highneſs</hi> and <hi>Mightineſs</hi> you ſhall not be able to endure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Neither will RICHES profit in the day of his wrath,</hi> Pro. 11.4. For though the rich mans <hi>wealth</hi> is his <hi>ſtrong</hi> City, and as an <hi>high</hi> wall in his <hi>own</hi> conceit, <hi>Pro.</hi> 18.11. yet it cannot preſerve him from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42649:95"/> by the hand of <hi>this Mighty One;</hi> ſo that there is no way to eſcape, but by a hearty <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the Son of God. Neither let the Greateſt and <hi>higheſt</hi> of the Earth thinke themſelves too Great and <hi>High</hi> to ſtoop to him, to whom <hi>every knee ſhall bow,</hi> (Rom: 14.10, 11.) for it is no weakneſs, nor baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but true mightineſs and nobleneſs of ſpirit to be willing to be overcome by, and to him; yea the Greateſt honour attainable here conſiſts in fulleſt ſubjection, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs to this Mighty One; The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of which ſhould cauſe <hi>ſtrangers</hi> and <hi>enemies,</hi> freely to <hi>ſubmit themſelves unto him,</hi> (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.44. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.3.) Beſides he hath power to <hi>forgive ſins</hi> paſt, and to make <hi>Rebels Favourites</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18.) and he waites that he may be thus gracious to them, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.) Yea though he be a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> the King of Glory (who could deſtroy the ſtrongeſt in a moment,) yet he <hi>knocks,</hi> yea he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to <hi>ſtand</hi> and <hi>knock at the doore of their hearts,</hi> deſiring to enter in that he might do them good, (<hi>Rev:</hi> 3.18, 19, 20.) Therefore Open to the King of Glory that he may come in, (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 24.9, 10.) and rule in you, and over you for ever; And as you have been much in <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt him be much in <hi>ſubjection</hi> to him.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:42649:95"/>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To CHRISTS SERVANTS.</hi> If <hi>Chriſt be Mighty,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Feare him,</hi> O ye his Saints; feare not man, nor any of the ſons of man that ſhall dye, that are as graſſe, but feare this Mighty One, the Lord that liveth for ever, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13.) He that hath all power both in Heaven and Earth, (<hi>Math.</hi> 28.18.) let him be your feare, let him be your dread, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.13.) and not the Mighty, or rather weak ones of the world, that <hi>kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do, Luke</hi> 12.4. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>the true and living God</hi> above all <hi>Idols,</hi> ſaith to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, Be not afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither alſo is it in them to do good, Foraſmuch as there is none like unto thee, O Lord: thou art great, and thy name is great in might, who would not feare thee, O King of Nations? for to thee doth it appertaine,</hi> Jer. 10.5, 6, 7. And this is the ſumme of the triumphant Song of them that <hi>get victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 15.3, 4. <hi>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints; who ſhall not feare thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Truſt in him;</hi> he is a <hi>ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> all the powers of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move it: He is a fit object for your

                     <hi>faith,</hi> ſeeing he is the LORD, Mighty to ſave, and to ſave to the uttermoſt out of the deepeſt dangers and troubles you can be brought into, (<hi>Heb:</hi> 7.25.) yea he hath <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the ſoules</hi> of his ſervants <hi>from deceit and violence</hi> heretofore, and will for ever <hi>ſhew himſelfe ſtrong on the behalfe of thoſe whoſe hearts are ſtay'd on him,</hi> (Pſal. 26.3, 4.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though ignorant worldlings ſlight and reject this Mighty One, and place their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Kings, Princes, Horſes, Chariots, (which do faile them often) yet do you that know his great and glorious Name, put your truſt in him, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7, 8.) yea <hi>at what time you are afraid,</hi> either of ſpirituall or temporall evils, <hi>truſt in him,</hi> in whom is everlaſting ſtrength, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.3.) you ſhall finde him ſufficient for you, and faithfull to you; <hi>He that beleeveth on him ſhall never be confounded,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Prize him above all;</hi> Prize him according to his excellent greatneſs. This was Gods <hi>deſigne</hi> in making him mighty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, 23. Do you further it, what in you lyeth, <hi>by honouring the Son, even as you honour the Father:</hi> If the people prized <hi>David</hi> farre above themſelves, ſaying, <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand of us,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.3. how ſhould we value <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, &amp; our Lord, who is the onely Potentate, King of Kings,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42649:96"/> and Lord of Lords, above our ſelves, and all things elſe, (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 6.15.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Stand by him, ſtand by his cauſe and intereſt all your dayes;</hi> Worke and love righteouſneſs evermore, though you be perſecuted for its ſake; yea though many ſhould forſake him through the unbeliefe of their hearts, as the Diſciples did of old, yet ſtand by him, and his work of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. For, he is <hi>Mighty to ſave you,</hi> (Iſa. 63.1.); It was <hi>Shammah's</hi> commendation, that he ſtood it out, and <hi>defended the Field alone,</hi> when all the people fled from the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.12. and the Lord wrought a great Victory.

                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Bleſſe God,</hi> even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who of his rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and by his great power, <hi>hath drawne you out of the world,</hi> and ſeparated you from your companions and brethren in iniquitie, and brought you from under the Dominion of <hi>other Lords,</hi> who were not able to ſave you, <hi>to be under this great and Mighty One.

                  <p>Yea <hi>Bleſſe God</hi> for that great grace vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to thee, <hi>that</hi> (in thy unregenerate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,) <hi>thou wert not confounded,</hi> and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>in thy oppoſition againſt Chriſt;</hi> for he is Mighty, and could have done it: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>child</hi> ſhould take a <hi>ſtick</hi> in its hand, and go into the <hi>Lions den,</hi> and there <hi>ſtrike the Lion,</hi> and the <hi>Lions whelpes,</hi> the young Lions; and <hi>continue</hi> beating them for ſome time with all its might, and yet the Lion <hi>not teare</hi> this child, nor meddle at all with it, but the child returne without any hurt done to it; <hi>what</hi> will this child <hi>ſay,</hi> when it comes to <hi>mans</hi> eſtate? It will be <hi>filled</hi> with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42649:97"/> and aſtoniſhment, when it ſhall be told what it did, and how it eſcaped; ſurely it will cry out with wonder, what a mercy, what a providence paſt finding out, that I was not devoured! I ſtroke the Lion, which was wont to devoure others. You that are <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſervants, you have been the <hi>Enemies</hi> of Chriſt, and his people; you have as it were ſtruck at the face of Chriſt by your oppoſition againſt him; yea peradventure you have <hi>continued</hi> ſome time beating Chriſt and his ſervants, provoking <hi>Chriſt</hi> (the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tribe of Judah</hi>) againſt you; and yet he did not teare you in pieces, as he did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but you are eſcaped; oh ſtudy what rich mercy and grace it is, that ſuch a bold rebellious wretch as you have been, ſhould be ſpared by this <hi>Mighty One!</hi> Surely you cannot look back upon ſuch delivering grace, without wondring, and being melted by it into love and ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, who hath thus loved and ſaved you from periſhing in, and by your iniquities.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, If <hi>Chriſt be Mighty, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get much of Chriſt,</hi> to be Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; not by <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the Name onely, but by <hi>participation</hi> of the Spirit of Chriſt; that ſo receiving the <hi>Anointing,</hi> you may be <hi>Mighty</hi> alſo.

                  <p>Much need not be added to prove that which the Scriptures do abundantly teſtifie, and the Saints conſtantly experience, yea the whole work of Chriſts <hi>Mediatourſhip</hi> is a large Demonſtration of this thing; For what is it but his being his <hi>peoples help?</hi> For, for this he <hi>came</hi> into the world, for this he <hi>lived</hi> here, and <hi>ſuffered</hi> ſuch grievous things; for this he <hi>dyed,</hi> for this he <hi>roſe againe,</hi> for this he <hi>aſcended,</hi> for this he <hi>ſits at the right hand of the Father,</hi> and for this he will <hi>come againe,</hi> even unto the perfect redemption and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all them that <hi>look for,</hi> and <hi>love his appearing,</hi> (Rom: 8.33, 34. <hi>Heb:</hi> 9.28. 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4.8.)

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:42649:100"/>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>POWER is requiſite to help;</hi> And Chriſt hath enough of that, for he hath <hi>all power,</hi> as hath been ſhewed at large, (<hi>Math.</hi> 28.18.) Power containes</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Authority;</hi> and he hath <hi>Authority,</hi> power of rule and Government over all, both perſons and things; for he is gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, and is on the right hand of God, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers being made ſubject to him, 1 <hi>Pet:</hi> 3.22. With this he encouraged his Diſciples when he ſent them into the world about his work, <hi>Math:</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>Jeſus came, and ſpake u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>to them, ſaying, All power is given unto me in Heaven, and in Earth; Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world;</hi> as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, I that have received ſuch great Authority from my Father, whereby I am ſufficiently able to help you, will continually ſtand by you, in all the work and dangers whereunto I call you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Strength and ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his purpoſes towards his people; and Chriſt is great in power in this reſpect; he is ſo ſtrong and mighty, that whatſoever things the Father doth, thoſe things he doth likewiſe, for as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickneth them, even ſo the Son quickneth whom he will, <hi>John</hi> 5.19, 21.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42649:100"/> Yea, all things are poſſible with him; He is the Lord God Omnipotent. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did make ſuch a reckoning of the ſufficiency of Chriſt to help in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as he ſaid, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me,</hi> Phil: 4.13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, WISDOME <hi>and</hi> COUNCEL <hi>is requiſite to help;</hi> yea, moſt requiſite. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> makes <hi>wiſdome</hi> more requiſite than <hi>ſtrength,</hi> for he ſaith, Eccleſ. 7.19. <hi>Wiſdome ſtrengthneth the wiſe more than the ten mighty men which are in the City; and wiſdome is better than ſtrength, and better than weapons of warre,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.16, 18. Hence it was ſaid of old, <hi>One Neſtor will do more ſervice than ten Ajaxes:</hi> And Chriſt is rich in this grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Councel is his,</hi> and ſound <hi>wiſdom;</hi> he is called <hi>Councellor, (Iſa.</hi> 9 6.) and as his <hi>Name</hi> is, ſo is <hi>he</hi> to his Servants; when they are in ſtraits and perplexities, and know not which way to turn them, then doth he <hi>guide them with his Counſel,</hi> Pſ 32.8. Yea, <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> Col: 2.3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Christ is furniſhed with what may incline him to help.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall inſtance onely in three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A <hi>Participation of the ſame Nature.</hi> Even Nature it ſelf teacheth, and promps
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42649:101"/> creatures to help their fellow-creatures, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe that partake of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with them; as beaſts, beaſts; men, men; ſo <hi>Christ</hi> having aſſumed the <hi>Humane</hi> Nature, ſo that his people are of his <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>his bone (Epheſ.</hi> 5.30.) He is thereby ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to extend reliefe and help to them in <hi>that Nature.</hi> The Apoſtle makes uſe of this Argument in his Exhortation to men to love their wives; and ſhews alſo how upon this very account Chriſt loveth and nouriſheth his Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.28, 29, 30. <hi>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodyes; he that loveth his wife, loveth himſelfe: For no man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but loveth and cheriſheth it, even as the Lord the Church; For we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his Bones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scriptures ſpeaking of Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and Helper of his people, do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtile him <hi>Man, Son of man.</hi> A <hi>man</hi> ſhall be as an hiding place from the wind, &amp;c. <hi>There is one Mediator between God and men, the MAN Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as being in the ſame Nature with his people, (1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2.5.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A <hi>Communication in the ſame conditions and ſufferings of his people in the ſame Nature;</hi> and this inclines him to help thoſe that are exerciſed with the ſame afflictions, which he himſelf endured: the Apoſtle doth
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42649:101"/> inſiſt much upon this, <hi>Heb:</hi> 2.16, 17, 18. <hi>Verily, he took not on him the Nature of</hi> Angels, <hi>but he took on him the ſeed of</hi> Abraham; <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all things it beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ved him to be made like unto his</hi> Brethren, <hi>that he might be</hi> a merciful, <hi>and</hi> faithful <hi>High-Prieſt, &amp;c. For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted;</hi> Chriſt hath been compaſſed about with <hi>troubles,</hi> he hath been in all conditions that his ſervants have been, or are in, except ſin; he hath been reproached, hated, perſecuted, tempted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo knows how to have Compaſſion on ſuch as are ſo uſed, (Heb: 4.15, 16.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Pity and Compaſſion.</hi> A ſpirit of compaſſion inclineth thoſe in whom it is, to help ſuch as are in trouble. It is ſaid of the Lord concerning his People, Iſa. 63.9. <hi>In his love, and in his pity he redeemed them, and bare them, and carryed them all the dayes of old.</hi> Gods <hi>pity</hi> inclined him to ſuch gracious actings towards them: Chriſts heart being full of <hi>pitty</hi> and compaſſion, is greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged towards his ſuffering ſervants; His pity towards them, ſets his power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a work for them. It was Chriſts <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion</hi> towards the multitude which moved him to put forth his power, and work a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to feed them, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.32.) And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this method, the man whoſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42649:102"/> ſon had the dumb ſpirit prayed, Mark. 9.22. <hi>If thou canſt do any thing, have compaſſion on us, and help us.</hi> This is very cleerly ſet forth by Chriſt himſelf in the Parable of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man, whom the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by, and helped not; but the <hi>Samaritane</hi> when he ſaw him, and <hi>had compaſſion</hi> on him, <hi>Went to him, and bound up his wounds, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Oyle and Wine, and ſet him on his own beaſt, and brought him to an Inne, and took care on him,</hi> Luke 10.30, 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Compaſſion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to <hi>Action,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> being of <hi>greateſt Compaſſion</hi> towards afflicted ones, is <hi>moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to help them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt is greatly engaged to help his Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several things ingage Chriſt to help; As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The intereſt that Chriſt hath in them.</hi> They are Chriſts portion and inheritance, yea, his peculiar treaſure, which he moſt loveth and prizeth, &amp; therefore cannot but help them in their difficulties and ſtraits. Upon this account God promiſed to help <hi>Jac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>b, Iſa:</hi> 43.1, 2. <hi>Fear not, O Jacob, thou art Mine;</hi> God challengeth <hi>Jacob</hi> to be <hi>his,</hi> and then he promiſeth his helping pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſaying, <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42649:102"/> they ſhall not overflow thee,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian</hi> peradventure will help a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> but much more the Patient in whom <hi>he hath an intereſt.</hi> The choſen ones are <hi>Chriſts own, his Father hath given him them; and therefore he careth for them, and keepeth them,</hi> John 17.6, 12. Neither are they <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>his goods,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> he hath a very neer propriety in them; they are a piece of himſelf, and thereupon he is engaged to help them.</p>
                  <p>The Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> takes notice of the love, and the continuance of the <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> towards thoſe in whom he had an intereſt, towards <hi>his own, Having loved his own which were in the world</hi> (he ſpeaks not of <hi>things,</hi> but of <hi>perſons) he loved them unto the end,</hi> John 13.1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Relations that Chriſt ſtands in towards them engage him to help.</hi> He is a <hi>Friend,</hi> and one Friend is engaged to help another; He is a <hi>Brother,</hi> and Brethren are engaged to help one another, (Prov: 17.17.) He is a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and the Shepherd is engaged to help the <hi>Flock;</hi> He is an <hi>Husband,</hi> and the Husband is engaged to help the Wife; He is a <hi>Father,</hi> and the Father is engaged to help the <hi>Child,</hi> Jer: 31.8, 9. He is a <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> and the Lord and Maſter ſtands engaged to help &amp; ſave <hi>his Servants.</hi> The Diſciples when they were in danger of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42649:103"/> being drowned, they beg'd his help upon the account of that Relation he ſtood in towards them, ſaying, <hi>Maſter, careſt thou not that we periſh?</hi> and like one engaged to help by vertue of that Relation, <hi>he preſently aroſe, and rebuked the wind,</hi> Mark 4.38, 39.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Promiſe of Christ is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Chriſt to help;</hi> and he hath promiſed to be with his people, and to carry them through all ſervices and ſufferings: So much he promiſed to his Diſciples, Mat. 28.19, 20. as alſo Mat. 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them;</hi> and Chriſt will not be idle in the midſt of his people; he will not barely behold them, but graciouſly help and aſſiſt them in their ſeveral conditions: And what a large promiſe of help doth Chriſt make to his <hi>Sheep,</hi> John 10.28. <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand:</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, I will ſtand by them, and lay out my power for their help and preſervation in every duty and danger which they may be called unto. And though <hi>men</hi> little regard their <hi>promiſes;</hi> yet <hi>Chriſt is faithfull,</hi> and will perform every good thing which he hath promiſed unto his Servants to do for them, (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.24.)</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:42649:103"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The honour that Christ ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his Servants whom he ſaves,</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to help, and ſave them out of their troubles, for he ſhall deliver them, and they ſhall glorifie him, (Pſal. 50.15.) When he hath been their <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>help,</hi> he ſhall be their <hi>Song;</hi> according to that in Iſaiah 12.3. <hi>The Lord, (Hebr: JAH) JEHOVAH is my ſtrength and my ſong;</hi> when the Lord hath <hi>holpen</hi> his people, they ſhall <hi>praiſe him,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce in his ſalvation.</hi> The Church makes this an Argument to engage God to help her in her low eſtate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.6, 7. <hi>Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoyce in thee? Shew us thy mercy O LORD, and grant us thy Salvation.</hi> And that Chriſt ſhall be glorified in his Saints, as well as they in him, is a ſtrong engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Chriſt to help them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the further opening and clearing of this</hi> firſt Branch of the Doctrine, namely, <hi>Christ being a Help to his People.</hi> I ſhall onely ſet before you

                        <item>1. WHAT MANNER <hi>of Help Christ is.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. HOW <hi>Chriſt doth help his people.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>What manner of Help is Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:42649:104"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>He is a</hi> SUFFICIENT <hi>Help;</hi> What ever the work, ſtrait, or condition be he can carry through it. Gods children of themſelves are not <hi>ſufficient</hi> for what they are called to, according to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. where he ſaith, <hi>Not that we</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding himſelf with the Saints at <hi>Corinth) are ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves;</hi> neither yet are others (though willing, and ſufficient in ſome meaſure to help) a <hi>ſufficient</hi> help for them; but it is Chriſts peculiar to be a ſufficient help; His hand is not onely <hi>ſufficient</hi> for <hi>himſelf,</hi> but alſo for the <hi>help of all his Servants. Moſes</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſidering the vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>Iſraels</hi> Rock, ſaith triumphantly in his ſong, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.31. <hi>Their Rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themſelves being Judges.</hi> And with this did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> encourage the people againſt the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and all the <hi>Multitude</hi> that was with him; <hi>With him is an arm of fleſh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us,</hi> 2 Chron: 32.7, 8. The Unbelievers help is but an <hi>Arm of fleſh,</hi> which will faile in time of need; but the <hi>Believers</hi> help is Chriſt Jeſus, the Mighty God, that fainteth not, neither can be weary, who alſo giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength, (Iſa. 40.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42649:104"/> 10, 11, 29.) This <hi>Paul</hi> experienced in his <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> and <hi>gloryed in his infirmities,</hi> that the <hi>power of Chriſt might reſt upon him,</hi> 2 Cor: 12.9. And of this, <hi>viz: The ſufficiency of Chriſts help,</hi> he had ſuch a cleer apprehenſion and ſtrong perſwaſion, as that he ſaid, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me,</hi> Phil: 4.13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He is a</hi> SEASONABLE <hi>help:</hi> as he is Mighty, and knows <hi>how</hi> to help; ſo he is Wiſe, and knows when to help. He that requires that his Servants ſhould bring forth <hi>fruit in ſeaſon,</hi> doth give forth ſtrength and help to them <hi>in ſeaſon</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he helps in the needfull time, (Heb: 4.16.) when it makes moſt for his <hi>glory</hi> to help, and for his <hi>peoples good</hi> to be holpen. He <hi>dyed in ſeaſon,</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom:</hi> 5.6. <hi>In due time Chriſt dyed for the ungodly.</hi> He comforteth them that are caſt down in ſeaſon (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.6.) He ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coureth the tempted in ſeaſon; when the ſoul is ready to faint, and fall by the ſtrength of the temptation, he comes in to its help; <hi>He hath the tongue of the Learned, and knows how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary,</hi> (Iſa. 50.4.) All the Miracles and wonders which he wrought, were a <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> help to them, upon and for whom he wrought them: and in this reſpect he is an <hi>excellent
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42649:105"/> help,</hi> every thing being <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>excellent in its ſeaſon,</hi> (Eccleſ: 3.11.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>He is a</hi> SUITABLE <hi>help;</hi> a meet help, <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the ſeveral <hi>eſtates</hi> of thoſe whom he is to help.</p>
                  <p>This appears from thoſe famous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.2, 3. <hi>A man ſhall be as an hiding place from the wind, a covert from the Tempeſt; as Rivers of waters in a dry place, as the ſhaddow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Iſa:</hi> 61.1, 3. <hi>The LORD hath anointed me to preach good tydings unto the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for aſhes, the oyl of joy for mourning; the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He is for a ſpirit of Judgement to him that ſitteth in Judgement, and for ſtrength to them that turn the battel to the gate,</hi> (Iſa: 28.6.) Therefore Chriſt is ſet forth under <hi>various</hi> Titles and Appellations, ſuitable to the <hi>various</hi> conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that his people are in, and the ſeveral <hi>Relations</hi> he ſtands in towards them, as a <hi>Father, Husband, Shepherd, King, Prieſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Meat, Drink, Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe.</hi> He gives <hi>reſt</hi> to the <hi>weary,</hi> Mat. 11.28. and <hi>Water, Wine, Milk</hi> to the <hi>thirſty,</hi> Iſa. 55.1. Revel: 22.17.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:42649:105"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>He is a</hi> CONSTANT <hi>help;</hi> he doth not only help at firſt, but at laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; he helps his own to the end, he will be with them, and not fail them, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, untill they have finiſhed all the work, and paſſed through all the troubles which he ſhall call them to; He is a <hi>finiſhing,</hi> and <hi>perfecting</hi> help, as well as a <hi>beginning help;</hi> he is <hi>Alpha and Omega, the Beginning, and the ending, Rev:</hi> 1.8, 10. <hi>The Authour and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of Faith,</hi> Heb: 12.2.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>He is an</hi> ONELY <hi>help;</hi> Chriſt is not a <hi>joynt</hi> help, or helper, an help in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with others; but he helps and ſaves alone; he is the <hi>LORD,</hi> and <hi>beſides</hi> him there is no <hi>Saviour,</hi> no helper. Indeed none can help but he; if we ſhould go to the mightieſt Creatures they would ſay, <hi>help is not in us;</hi> the <hi>Valiant</hi> man would ſay, <hi>it is not in me;</hi> the <hi>Wiſe</hi> man would ſay, <hi>it is not in me;</hi> the <hi>Rich</hi> man would ſay, it <hi>is not in me:</hi> Yea all the Creatures muſt ſay to them that come to them for help, as that King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when ſhe cryed to him, <hi>Help my Lord, O King;</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>If the LORD do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee?</hi> It is Chriſt, and Chriſt alone that helpeth, neither is there any other that can ſave in all the Cityes, nor among all the Judges of the earth; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42649:106"/> to the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 4.12. <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other: there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>He is an Antient,</hi> OLD <hi>help, and helper;</hi> Not to conſider him in reſpect of Gods appointing him, which was from everlaſting; but of mans need of him, which was as ſoon as he had ſinned: for he thereby became liable to the curſe and wrath of God, and man being a guilty, weak creature, could not deliver himſelf out of this danger; neither could any of the Creatures help him, nor yet God himſelf (being juſt as well as merciful) would free this offender from his threatned puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (any other way:) then Chriſt, who was given forth in the promiſe, became an help to him, and ſaved him out of that deep pit into which he was fallen; and thus <hi>Chriſt was an help of old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Chriſt is a</hi> FREE, UNDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERVED HELP. As there was nothing in the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to cauſe God to raiſe them up <hi>Saviours</hi> and Deliverers, ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and others, <hi>Types</hi> of Chriſt; (for they were a ſtubborn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people,) ſo there was nothing of good in us, or done by us, to move God to ſend <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be an <hi>help;</hi> nor to incline
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42649:106"/> Chriſt to be an help to us, but he was <hi>freely</hi> ſent, and <hi>he freely</hi> came to the <hi>help</hi> of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Chriſt himſelf gives this account of <hi>his Fathers</hi> giving him to help and ſave; John 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son; that whoſoever beleeveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> It was Gods <hi>love,</hi> not the worlds, not his peoples deſert, that prevailed with him to give his Son. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives the ſame account of <hi>Chriſts giving himſelf</hi> for his <hi>Church, Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Christ alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it;</hi> ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is both in reſpect of his <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>himſelf</hi> alſo, a <hi>free help.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>He is a</hi> TRYED, EXPERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTED HELP: There hath been proof made of him, and all the faithful in their ſeveral Generations have found <hi>Christ</hi> an <hi>help</hi> to them in their various conditions; ſo that they can ſet to their <hi>Seal</hi> that he is an <hi>Help.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> hath abundantly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf an <hi>Helper</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> of his people in the time of their trouble; he hath ſaved many a <hi>ſinner,</hi> he hath ſuccoured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a <hi>tempted</hi> One, he hath healed many a <hi>wounded</hi> One, he hath ſet free many a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he hath comforted many a <hi>mourner,</hi> he hath ſtrengthned many a <hi>weak</hi> One, he hath given reſt to many a <hi>weary</hi> ſoul, he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42649:107"/> hath carryed many <hi>through manifold tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>preſerved</hi> them unto <hi>his Heavenly</hi> Kingdom. Yea all the Saints in glory can teſtifie, and ſay, <hi>we</hi> were <hi>weake, faint,</hi> and <hi>inſufficient</hi> ones for the worke whereunto we were called; we were <hi>tempted, reproached, afflicted, hated, perſecuted;</hi> but <hi>Christ helped us</hi> to do all our work, and he delivered us out of all our troubles</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>He is a</hi> GENERAL, uNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSAL HELP, an <hi>help</hi> in all caſes, in caſes wherein others cannot help; for there is <hi>nothing too hard for Chriſt,</hi> (Jer. 32.17.27.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gods ſervants ſtand in need of help.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, In reſpect of <hi>ſervice, and work which they have to do;</hi> Chriſt is an <hi>help</hi> in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; he works all their works in them, and for them; yea, <hi>He worketh in them both to will and to do,</hi> (Phil: 2.13. John 15.5.) By him it is, not onely in reſpect of <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> but <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> alſo, that they offer up their ſpiritual ſacrifices to God. Would any <hi>pray?</hi> it is not onely through <hi>his merit</hi> that they have acceſs with confidence, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13, 18.) but it is <hi>his Spirit that helpeth their infirmities, when they know not what they ſhould pray for as they ought,</hi> Rom: 8.26. Would any one <hi>praiſe</hi> the Lord? that ſacrifice alſo
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42649:107"/> is to be <hi>offered up by him, Heb:</hi> 13.15. <hi>By him let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;</hi> Yea, whatever the Saints do, muſt be through his help, and ſo <hi>they can do all things, Phil.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In reſpect of <hi>trouble and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;</hi> For Gods Servants of themſelves neither know <hi>how</hi> to ſuffer, nor yet to <hi>free themſelves</hi> from ſufferings; but Chriſt is an <hi>help</hi> in both caſes; for though his <hi>ſuccouring them</hi> in Temptation, his <hi>comforting</hi> them in Tribulation, and <hi>ſupporting</hi> them in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are able to bear their Burthens; and by, and through him helping them, they know how to be abaſed, how to be hungry, and ſuffer need, how to be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and hated of all men for his names ſake, (2 Cor: 4.10, 11.) yea, they can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as well as do <hi>All things, through Chriſt which ſtrengthneth them, (Phil:</hi> 4.12, 13.)</p>
                  <p>Neither is he an <hi>help</hi> onely <hi>in</hi> trouble, but alſo a <hi>Deliverer out of</hi> Trouble; for he takes away <hi>reproach</hi> from his people, he wipes away <hi>tears</hi> from their eyes, he breaks <hi>yokes</hi> from off their necks, he removes <hi>burdens</hi> from off their ſhoulders, and baniſheth <hi>fears</hi> from their hearts; in a word, he rebukes <hi>Satan,</hi> and reproves Kings for their ſakes; (Pſal. 105.14.) and ſets them in ſafety from every one that puffeth at them, (Pſal.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42649:108"/> 12.5.) They that write the ſtoryes of <hi>Egypt,</hi> report, that there is no Country in which there are ſo many <hi>venemous</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and no Country hath ſo many <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes</hi> againſt poyſon as are there: there is no people that have ſo many <hi>Troubles</hi> as faithful <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and none have ſo much <hi>help,</hi> both in, and from trouble, as they have; And <hi>that</hi> HELP <hi>is</hi> CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How is Chriſt an help?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Chiefly</hi> FIVE <hi>Wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>By the vertue and efficacy of his</hi> DEATH. For though the Death of others ſpeak forth their <hi>inability,</hi> and incapacity to <hi>help</hi> any longer; yet <hi>Chriſts death</hi> is ſo far from being his weakneſs, and his ceaſing to help any further, that it is of <hi>wonderfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>efficacy,</hi> and a ſtanding abiding help to his weak Servants. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Triumphant challenge to the <hi>enemies</hi> of Gods elect, layes much weight upon the help of Chriſt in this reſpect, Rom: 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that Juſtifieth; who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is of ſuch great power and efficacy, as that the Gracious ſoul from
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42649:108"/> thence (as from a <hi>Fountain</hi> of all good) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth daily <hi>ſupplyes</hi> of ſtrength, and help in every time of need; to the making it victorious over all evils and enemies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: It is of ſuch <hi>vertue,</hi> as that it <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">

                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is the death of Chriſt the price onely of our Redemption from manifold deſerved evils; but the purchaſe alſo of our glorious, heavenly inheritance; For hereby he hath procured eternal life for all thoſe, who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, (<hi>Rom:</hi> 2.7.) Hereby alſo he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Teſtament</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace to his people: <hi>For where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the Teſtator. For a Teſtament is of force after men are dead; otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all, whileſt the Teſtator liveth,</hi> Heb: 9.16, 17. And thus <hi>Chriſt is an help by the vertue of his</hi> Death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>By the Excellency of his</hi> EXAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE. An <hi>Example,</hi> a Copy, or a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is an help, and for an help, and in that Chriſt hath given us his <hi>Example,</hi> he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by helpeth us; the more excellent alſo the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42649:109"/> Example is, the greater is its help; and there is an excellency in Chriſts example, whereby he helpeth them much that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</p>
                  <p>It is the <hi>Prime, Chief,</hi> and <hi>abſolute Example;</hi> not regulated by any other, but all other to be conformed to it; and therefore we are to be <hi>followers of others,</hi> onely <hi>as they are of him.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would not preſs his <hi>own Example</hi> upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but with <hi>this</hi> limitation, 1 Cor. 11.1. <hi>Be ye followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt:</hi> But the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of Chriſt affords a certainty to the ſoul what to follow, and hold to, and ſo becomes a choice <hi>help,</hi> and furtherance to a Chriſtian in his walk, above the <hi>Example</hi> of any other, which he is to examine, and try, and follow, and refuſe as it agreeth, or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with this.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there are <hi>no blots,</hi> defects, nor <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections;</hi> but contrariwiſe a wonderfull <hi>exactneſs, plainneſs,</hi> beauty, and <hi>glory</hi> in the <hi>Example of Chriſt,</hi> whereby it is of ſingular uſe and advantage to his followers, their way being thereby made <hi>plaine</hi> before them.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it a ſcant, but a full, and large <hi>Example,</hi> both of <hi>obedience,</hi> (For <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walke, even as he walked,</hi> 1 John 2.6.) and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42649:109"/> 
                     <hi>parts</hi> thereof; he hath given us an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of <hi>faith, love, patience, ſelf-denyall, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diligence,</hi> &amp;c. And of <hi>ſuffering</hi> alſo, (that he might help in that needfull time;) To encourage us to it, he hath given us an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of <hi>readineſs,</hi> and <hi>willingneſs</hi> to ſuffer; he <hi>willingly</hi> laid downe his life for his <hi>ſheepe, (Joh.</hi> 10.15.18.) and to guide us in it, he hath given us an example of <hi>meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>patie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce,</hi> for <hi>he was led as a ſheep to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and like a lamb dumb before the ſhearer, ſo opened he not his mouth,</hi> Acts 8.32. And <hi>when he was reviled, reviled not againe; when he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he threatned not,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. And thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an <hi>Help</hi> by the <hi>excellency</hi> of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>By the powerfulneſs of his Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, is a Spirit of life and power, which he giveth forth into the hearts of his ſervants for their help, in their various ſervices and conditions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſaid to <hi>help their Infirmities, Rom:</hi> 8.26. Yea Chriſt doth ſo uſually <hi>help</hi> by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> that moſt acts of help are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attributed, in Scripture, to the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> as to <hi>Quicken, uphold, ſtrengthen, comfort, teach, lead, beare witneſs, bring to remembrance, give utterance, cauſe to do, John</hi> 6.63. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. <hi>John</hi> 14.16. <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.4.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42649:110"/> 
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. By <hi>this</hi> did Chriſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>help</hi> his ſervants in the work whereunto he called them in the <hi>primitive</hi> times; By <hi>this</hi> he enabled them to be <hi>his witneſſes,</hi> not onely <hi>in Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>in all Judea, and in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, but unto the uttermoſt part of the earth, Acts</hi> 1.8. By <hi>this</hi> they <hi>evercame</hi> the <hi>mightieſt</hi> Adverſaries of Truth; For they were <hi>not able to reſiſt the wiſdome and ſpirit by which they ſpake,</hi> (Luke 21.15. Acts 6.10.) And by <hi>this</hi> he helped them to do many wonderful things, to the great advantage and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Goſpel, (<hi>Act.</hi> 11.19-21.) By the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> he hath helped others alſo in later Generations to teſtifie for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and his Adherents, and by their Teſtimony exceedingly to prevaile; as <hi>Wickliffe, Hus, Luther,</hi> and others. And this is that which <hi>Luther</hi> in an Epiſtle to ſome amongſt whom his doctrine was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull, would have them to obſerve; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with what</hi> ſword <hi>I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered ſin, and overcome Errours, and ſubdued policy; I have never touched you with a</hi> finger, <hi>but with the</hi> Spirit <hi>of Chriſts mouth,</hi> viz. <hi>the Sword of his Goſpel.</hi> And ſeverall of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>

                     </gap>hough meane, and unlearned, yet by the help of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, have put to ſilence their learned Adverſaries: Among the reſt, Hiſtory tells us of one <hi>Alice Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:42649:110"/> that ſhee <hi>non-pluſt</hi> the <hi>Doctors</hi> that Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined her, and then ſaid, <hi>God be honoured, you be not able to reſiſt the</hi> Spirit <hi>of God in a poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> And as it was then, even ſo it is now, for Chriſt by the <hi>ſame Spirit,</hi> helpeth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants both to will, and to do, and to ſuffer, of his good pleaſure, (<hi>Phil:</hi> 1.29. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>By the Admirableneſs of his R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE, and Adminiſtration;</hi> For he ſo ordereth, and diſpoſeth of all things, that <hi>they work together for good, to them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28. ſo that thoſe things which men contrive, and deſigne to be moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, (through his power and wiſdome) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come helpfull to his ſervants, yea he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times makes his <hi>Enemies</hi> intended <hi>Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> his <hi>peoples</hi> glorious <hi>ſalvation.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Reigne</hi> of Chriſt, doth much conſiſt in his helping and relieving his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſervants, in his pleading their cauſe, and executing judgement for them; in his breaking the bands of their yoke, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them out of the hand of thoſe that ſerve themſelves of them, that they may be no more a prey to the Heathen; yea the maine deſigne of Chriſt, next to his own Glory, is the <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> of his <hi>flock, Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. And he doth many <hi>admirable</hi> things in order to this end; as he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42649:111"/> maketh the <hi>weak</hi> to conquer, and the <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to be overthrowne; he maketh the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the <hi>ſimple</hi> to ſtand, and the devices of the <hi>crafty</hi> to be diſappointed; he doth that marvellous work, and a wonder, ſpoken of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.14. <hi>He cauſeth the wiſdome of wiſe men to periſh, and the underſtanding of the prudent to be hid:</hi> And <hi>he judgeth the poore of the people, and ſaveth the children of the needy; and breaketh in pieces the Oppreſſor,</hi> Pſal. 72.4.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he ſets enemies one againſt another; The Mighty againſt the Mighty, Ruler againſt Ruler, <hi>Jer:</hi> 46.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.46. ſo that they fight, Brother againſt Brother, Neighbour againſt Neighbour, City againſt City, Kingdome againſt Kingdome, and ſo help to deſtroy one another, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 19.2. 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 20.23. Sometimes he wonderfully <hi>reſtraines</hi> the rage of Enemies, ſo that they do <hi>not hurt, nor deſtroy in his holy Mountaine,</hi> but <hi>the Wolfe dwelleth with the Lamb, and the Leopard lies downe with the Kid; and the Calfe, and the young Lion, and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them;</hi> according to that famous propheſie of his Kingdome, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he cauſeth them to <hi>favour his</hi> people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.46. and ſometimes he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them <hi>helpfull and ſerviceable to them;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that precious promiſe of God to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42649:111"/> his Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.10. <hi>The ſons of ſtrangers ſhall build up thy walls, and their Kings ſhall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto thee.</hi> Thus <hi>God turned the heart of the King of (Perſia</hi> that was now over) <hi>Aſſyria unto his people, to ſtrengthen their hands in the work of the houſe of God, of the God of Iſrael,</hi> Ezra 6.22. And <hi>put it alſo into the heart of</hi> Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes <hi>to help</hi> Ezra <hi>to beautifie the houſe of the Lord which was at Jeruſalem,</hi> Ezra 7.27. And thus <hi>Chriſt helpeth by the Admirableneſs of his R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE and Adminiſtration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>By the prevalency of his Interceſſion;</hi> by this he helpeth them much who beleeve through grace. Chriſt <hi>perfecteth</hi> by his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi> that good worke of the ſalvation of his people which he <hi>begun</hi> by his <hi>Paſſion;</hi> for though Chriſt help exceedingly by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy of his <hi>death,</hi> as hath been ſhewne, yet there is need of his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> alſo, and therefore he is entred into heaven <hi>to appeare in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb: 9.24. And this is of ſuch great benefit, and advantage to the Saints, that the Apoſtle layes the <hi>weight</hi> of their <hi>ſalvation</hi> upon it, <hi>Rom:</hi> 5.10. <hi>If when we were</hi> enemies, <hi>we were reconciled to God by the</hi> death <hi>of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be</hi> ſaved <hi>by his life;</hi> and indeed, it is now ſufficient for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and therefore Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto

And as the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt is of great uſe</hi> and help to a Chriſtian in <hi>all caſes,</hi> ſo eſpecially in theſe <hi>THREE CASES.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In caſe of ſin;</hi> to that purpoſe are the words of <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In caſe of Satans Temptations and deſignes againſt his ſervants;</hi> ſo much may be gathered from the words of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi>

               <p>Firſt, The <hi>weakneſs of his people;</hi> they being a feeble flock, of a very little ſtrength, and the Lord loves to ſtrengthen the weake hands; <hi>Feare not thou Worme Jacob</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will help thee,</hi> Iſa: 41.10, 14. Chap. 35.3.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Difficulty of their worke;</hi> It is not onely hard, but impoſſible to fleſh and blood to performe; Every part of it is hard; it is hard to <hi>beleeve,</hi> hard to <hi>pray,</hi> hard to <hi>deny a mans ſelfe,</hi> hard to <hi>forſake fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>mother, wife, children, brethren</hi> and <hi>ſiſters, houſes</hi> and <hi>lands,</hi> and a mans <hi>life</hi> too for Chriſts ſake (<hi>Luke</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26.)

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As the Lord hath appointed Chriſt to be an help, ſo <hi>he hath alſo appointed a time for his people to ſuffer in;</hi> For as <hi>Christ,</hi> this Mighty One, <hi>had a ſuffering time in reſpect of HIS PERSON,</hi> in which he was ſet at nought, and derided, and perſecuted both by people, and Rulers, (before he entred into his Glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26.) ſo he ſhall have <hi>in reſpect of his myſticall body the Saints,</hi> before they enter into the promiſed <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> Thus much God told <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he appeared to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13, 14. ſaying, <hi>Know of a ſurety, that thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtranger in a land that is not theirs, and ſhall ſerve them;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42649:115"/> and they ſhall afflict them foure hundred yeares; And alſo that Nation whom they ſhall ſerve, will I Judge; and afterward ſhall they come out with Great ſubſtance.</hi> So likewiſe there was a <hi>time</hi> when the Lord ſaid to <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah; Bring your necks under the yoke of the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and ſerve him, and his people,</hi> Jer: 27.12. And they were to be <hi>quiet</hi> in that eſtate till <hi>ſeventy yeares</hi> were accompliſhed. And there was a <hi>time</hi> wherein God would <hi>break his yoke</hi> from off his peoples neck, and <hi>burſt</hi> their <hi>bonds,</hi> that ſtrangers might no more ſerve themſelves of them, <hi>Jer:</hi> 30.8, There is <hi>a day of Jacobs trouble,</hi> and there is a <hi>time, when he ſhall be ſaved out of it,</hi> (verſ. 7.) And when <hi>the time to favour</hi> Zion, <hi>yea the</hi> ſet time <hi>be come, God will ariſe and have mercy upon</hi> her, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 102.13. But the day of the Lords patience, and his peoples ſufferings, muſt precede the day of his vengeance, and his peoples ſalvation. The ſervant, as well as his Lord, muſt ſuffer, before he enter into Glory, (<hi>Rom:</hi> 8.17.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Lord hath ſeveral wayes of helping his ſervants;</hi> his help doth not conſiſt onely in <hi>freeing</hi> them from ſufferings, but alſo in <hi>upholding,</hi> and ſupporting them under ſufferings, ſo that they faint not in the evil day. Thus the Lord promiſed to help <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> Iſa: 41.10. <hi>Feare thou not, For I am with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42649:115"/> thee; be not diſmayed, for I am thy God. I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> With <hi>this way</hi> of help from the Lord, the Apoſtle labours to encourage the Saints at <hi>Corinth</hi> in their Temptations, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above that you are able; but will with the</hi> Temptation <hi>alſo make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to beare it.</hi> Chriſt doth as well help his ſervants by keeping them from <hi>falling</hi> by Temptation, as by <hi>delivering them</hi> out of temptation; Thus Chriſt hath been, is, and will be the help of his people in their ſuffering day.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> be Mighty to help, and ſave to the uttermoſt all his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And thus God helped his people <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> in <hi>Ezra's</hi> dayes, which he <hi>thankfully</hi> took notice of in his Confeſſion and Prayer, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.7, 8, 9. <hi>For our iniquities have we, our Kings, and our Prieſts been delivered into the hand of the Kings of the Lands, to the ſword, to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42649:116"/> captivity, and to a ſpoil, and to confuſion of face, as it is this day; and now for a little ſpace grace hath been ſhewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a Remnant to eſcape, and to give us a Nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; For we were bond men, yet our God hath not forſaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the ſight of the Kings of Perſia, to give us a reviving,</hi> &amp;c. It was the gracious Promiſe of God to his People, whom he caſt far off among the Heathen, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among the Countries, <hi>That he would be to them as a little Sanctuary in the Countryes where they ſhould come, Ezek:</hi> 11.16.

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Deliverances and Salvation of Gods people are commonly carryed on in a Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of God.</hi> Gods Providence towards his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42649:116"/> is as a <hi>Wheel</hi> in the <hi>midſt</hi> of a <hi>Wheel,</hi> (as <hi>Ezek:</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.16.) whoſe motion and work, and end in working, is not diſcerned by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon eye. Chriſt doth ſometimes walk in the dark, when he is <hi>helping</hi> his People, as the loving father is contriving good for his child, though the child perceiveth it not; to this agreeth that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Ch: 45. verſ. 15. <hi>Verily, thou art a God that hideſt thy ſelf, O God of Iſrael, the Saviour:</hi> Yea, God is ſometimes in a way of deliverance with his People, and their deliverance neer, when he ſeems to ingage them to greater ſufferings. There is ſo much contained in that promiſe of God to <hi>Zion, Micah</hi> 4.10. <hi>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth O Daughter of Zion, like a woman in travel; for now ſhalt thou go forth out of the City, and thou ſhalt dwell in the field, and thou ſhalt go even to Babylon; there ſhalt thou be delivered; there the LORD ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</hi> We muſt not conclude that Chriſt doth not <hi>help</hi> us, becauſe we ſee not his hand lifted up.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>There is</hi> SOMETHING IN CHRISTS SERVANTS <hi>becauſe of which he doth not ſometimes help them;</hi> as ſometimes <hi>CHRIST DOTH NOT HELP:</hi> ſometimes</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When his people do not beleeve,</hi> do not truſt nor ſtay upon him for <hi>help;</hi> for he is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42649:117"/> an <hi>help</hi> to all them that truſt in him; for any one to <hi>diſtrust</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of Chriſt, is to exclude himſelf from partaking of the benefit thereof. When the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> beleeved not the word of God, the Lord did not <hi>help</hi> them, <hi>but lifted up his hand againſt them to overthrow them in the wilderneſſe,</hi> Pſa. 106.24, 26. <hi>Chriſt did not many mighty works in his own Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their unbelief, Math.</hi> 13.58. If thou doſt not <hi>beleeve</hi> that he can, and will help, thou canſt not <hi>expect</hi> he ſhould <hi>help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>When they ſet about any work without his call;</hi> The Lord hath been wont to help in thoſe things he hath called his Servants to, as might eaſily be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in <hi>Moſes, Joſuah, Gideon, David,</hi> and others; but when his People have run, and he <hi>ſent them not,</hi> they have been without his <hi>help</hi> in ſuch undertakings. When the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would <hi>invade the Land of Canaan without Gods call,</hi> they were <hi>ſmitten,</hi> and <hi>diſcomfited, Numb:</hi> 14.44, 45. And though <hi>Joſiah</hi> was a good man, yet <hi>going to fight againſt Pharaoh Necho,</hi> contrary to the <hi>mind of God,</hi> he dyed for it, 2 Chron 35.20, 21, 22, 23. They that act without Chriſts call, are like to act without his <hi>help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>When they undertake any work,</hi> though never ſo good and excellent in at
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42649:117"/> ſelf, <hi>in their own ſtrength, without engaging him to their help, he helps</hi> them not; as in the caſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> it was a good work, and much conducing to the honour of Chriſt, which <hi>Peter</hi> undertook; but truſting to his own ſtrength, Chriſt left him to miſcarry in it (John 13.37, 38.)</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>When the eyes of his people are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome other</hi> beſides him, or <hi>when they joyn ſome other with him to help,</hi> then he uſually leaveth <hi>both him that helpeth, and him that is holpen to fall together,</hi> Iſa. 31.3. The Lord was <hi>Iſraels help</hi> when he was their <hi>God alone, and none other with him,</hi> Deut: 32.12. <hi>The LORD alone did lead them, and there was no ſtrange God with him.</hi> When the Spouſe ſhall lean upon Chriſt her Beloved, and upon other Lovers alſo, then Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth his help from her.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>When they have any ſiniſter ends and aims in what they do;</hi> for though the work be good, yet if a mans end be bad, Chriſt doth not uſually further him in it; as when a man in <hi>Preaching, Praying,</hi> or any part of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſeeks not ſo much <hi>Chriſts honour,</hi> as his <hi>own praiſe</hi> and <hi>profit,</hi> he cannot expect, neither doth he ordinarily receive ſuch <hi>help</hi> from the Spirit of Chriſt therein; They that <hi>ſeek not Chriſts things, but their own,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42649:118"/> ſhall not proſper,</hi> Jer: 10.21. Haggai 1.4, 6, 9.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>When they refuſe to be holpen by him;</hi> Chriſts Servants are ſometimes more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in great dangers and ſtraits, and ſtand in need of his help: and though Chriſt ſhew himſelf willing and ready to ſave, and deliver them, yet ſuch is the folly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardneſſe of their ſpirits, that they <hi>will none of his help,</hi> but rather chuſe to ſuffer through walking in the wayes and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of their own hearts, than to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in their hearkning to his counſel, and ſubmitting to his will; and then no wonder <hi>Chriſt helps not;</hi> this was the frame of ſpirit, and ſad condition of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which Chriſt <hi>lamented</hi> over, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was in danger, Chriſt would have holpen her, but <hi>ſhe would not,</hi> Chriſt lets her alone, and the iſſue is ſad, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37, 38. <hi>O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten would I have gathered thy children together, even as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and ye would not? behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What ſhall Gods people do when Chriſt helps not?</hi>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Seriouſly conſider, and lay it to heart, as a matter of greateſt concernment, and trouble to us.</hi> So did <hi>Joſhua</hi> when the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his help from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Joſhua 7.6, 8. <hi>Joſuah rent his cloathes, and fell to the earth upon his face, before the Ark of the LORD, untill the even-tide, he and the Elders of Iſrael, and put duſt upon their heads; and Joſhua ſaid, Alas, O Lord God, wherefore haſt thou at all brought this people over Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to deſtroy us? would to God,</hi> (Hebr: <hi>O that) we had been content, and dwelt on the other ſide Jordan. Oh LORD, what ſhall I ſay, when Iſrael turneth their backs before their enemies?</hi> We ſhould look upon it as that wherein both <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>People</hi> ſuffer. <hi>God</hi> ſuffers in his name, when he doth not <hi>help</hi> his people; His, and their enemies blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his name. Sometimes they caſt dirt upon his <hi>power,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Lord cannot help,</hi> nor ſave; ſometimes upon his goodneſſe, and mercy, <hi>The Lord will not help;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon his Truth and Faithfulneſſe, <hi>The Lord hath forgotten his people:</hi> Hence ſaith <hi>Joſhua, What wilt thou do for thy great name?</hi> And <hi>his people</hi> they muſt needs ſuffer when he with-draws his hand; they are endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, and trampled upon by their enemies: and the ſuffering of Gods Name, and the diſtreſſes of his Servants, muſt not ſeem a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42649:119"/> light thing in our eyes. <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> frame and carriage under ſuch a diſpenſation, is worthy of imitation. <hi>When he heard that the Remnant that were left of the Captivity were in great affliction, and reproach, that the wall of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem was broken down, and the gates thereof burnt with fire, he ſat down and wept, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain dayes, and faſted, and prayed before the God of Heaven,</hi> Neh: 1.3, 4. And this is that which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> lamented with much bitterneſs of ſpirit, Lament: 1.15, 16. <hi>The Lord hath troden under foot all my mighty men, in the midſt of me; he hath called an Aſſembly againſt me to cruſh my young men, the Lord hath troden the Virgin, the Daughter of Judah, as a Wine-preſſe; For theſe things I weep, mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, becauſe the Comforter that ſhould relieve my ſoul is far from me.</hi> It's juſt matter of mourning and <hi>lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> when the <hi>appointed helper</hi> and Saviour doth not help nor ſave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>They ſhould diligently ſearch out the cauſe and reaſon why Chriſt helps not:</hi> For if the Lord ceaſe to help his People, there is <hi>ſome cauſe</hi> for ſuch a dealing, as there is for <hi>what evil ſoever the Lord bring upon them,</hi> Ezek. 14.23. And when the Lord ſlacks his hand concerning the help of his Servants, its their preſent work and duty to look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly about them, and in them, to find out
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42649:119"/> the cauſe thereof. When the Lord <hi>denyed Iſrael</hi> his help againſt the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> he told them the cauſe of it, <hi>There is an accurſed thing in the midſt of thee, O Iſrael;</hi> and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and directed them to ſeek, and they found it out, <hi>Achan was taken, and the Silver, and the Garment, and the wedge of Gold, his Sons, Daughters, Aſſes, Sheep, Tent, and all that he had, and they ſtoned him, and burned them with fire,</hi> Joſhua 7. This was part of <hi>Jobs</hi> work in his affliction, to find out the <hi>cauſe</hi> of it, and that he might know it, he begs of God to <hi>ſhew him wherefore he contended with him,</hi> Job 10.2. Thus did <hi>David</hi> alſo in his diſtreſſe, Pſa. 22.1. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? why art thou ſo far from helping me:</hi> And we find the Faithful in their low and helpleſſe eſtate calling upon one another to this very thing, <hi>Lament:</hi> 3.40. <hi>Let us ſearch, and try our wayes, and turn again to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>They ſhould humbly acknowledge, and really forſake thoſe evils wherewith they have provoked Chriſt to with-hold his help from them in time of need.</hi> The Faithful do not onely complain of their miſery and troubles, but they confeſſe, and forſake their iniquities; when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> conſidered the afflicted condition of the People, he doth not onely put them upon faſting and confeſſion, but
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42649:120"/> upon reformation alſo, <hi>Neh:</hi> 13. This is that which the Lord ſo frequently calls for at the hands of his people, <hi>Turn, turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions;</hi> And they alſo call upon God for this, <hi>Lam:</hi> 5.21. <hi>Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>They ſhould earneſtly cry to the Lord for help;</hi> This hath been the courſe of the ſervants of God of old, whereby they have prevailed with God to lift up his hand to their help in time of trouble. The Church <hi>lifted up</hi> her voice in affliction, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Awake, why ſleepeſt thou, O Lord? Ariſe, caſt us not off for ever</hi> (Pſal. 44.23.) <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hideſt thou thy face, and forgetteſt our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and oppreſſion? For our ſoul is bowed down to the duſt, our belly cleaveth to the earth; ariſe for our help, and redeem us for thy mercy ſake,</hi> This is a tryed means; ſaith <hi>David, This poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f all his troubles,</hi> Pſal. 34.6. When the men of <hi>Gibeon</hi> were in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe and danger by reaſon of five Kings coming againſt them, and needed help, they ſent to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Slack not thy hand from thy ſervants, come up to us quickly, and ſave us, and help us,</hi> Joſhua 10.6. So ſhould all the ſervants of the Lord cry to their <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> whom God hath made ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> for them, <hi>to come and help,</hi> and ſave them
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42649:120"/> out of all their troubles When the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were in danger on the Sea, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed help, they cryed to Chriſt to <hi>ſave</hi> them, they <hi>awaked</hi> him, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Maſter, careſt thou not that we periſh? and he aroſe, and rebuked the wind,</hi> Mark 4.38, 39. O ye Saints, cry to Chriſt; and the more he ſeems to neglect you, cry ſo much the more earneſtly and conſtantly, and give him no reſt till he hear and help, and redeem you from all evils.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>They ſhould patiently wait upon Chriſt for help;</hi> Though Chriſt do not help preſently, yet wait upon him, for he will help in due time; Do as Beggars that have but one doore to go to for bread, if none hear, nor help them preſently, they <hi>lay them down at the door,</hi> ſaying within themſelves, we will <hi>wait here,</hi> may be their compaſſions will move them as they paſſe by to help us: God forbid that any of Chriſts Servants ſhould ſay, either with heart or mouth, as that perſon, 2 Kings 6.33. <hi>What ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> but rather to follow the counſel of the man after Gods own heart, mentioned Pſal. 37.7. <hi>Reſt in the LORD, and wait patiently for him, and for his help; though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry;</hi> and in the mean time know, <hi>It is a good thing that a man
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42649:121"/> ſhould both hope and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the LORD,</hi> Lament: 3.26. Such only ſhall ſay, and ſing in the day that the Lord ariſe for the help of his people, <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us; This is the LORD, we have waited for him; we will be glad, and rejoyce in his ſalvation,</hi> Iſa. 25.9.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>When may Gods people groundedly expect that Christ will help them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When they are afflicted greatly;</hi> when their burthens are ſo heavy, that they know not how to bear them, then the Lord hath been wont to help them. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> made the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſerve with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, ſo that they <hi>ſighed</hi> and <hi>groaned</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their bondage; and the <hi>LORD ſaw the affliction of his people,</hi> and delivered them out of the hand of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 1.13. &amp; 2.23. &amp; 3.—7,—8. And at another time, <hi>when God ſaw the affliction of the children of Iſrael that it was bitter, he ſaved them by the hand of Jeroboam,</hi> 2 Kings 14.26, 27. This <hi>David</hi> experienced, and acknowledgeth to the praiſe of God, Pſal. 116.6.—10.—16.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42649:121"/> ſaying, <hi>I was brought low, and he helped me; I was greatly afflicted, O LORD, thou haſt looſed my bonds:</hi> And he profeſſeth faith in God for the ſame towards others, Pſal. 18.27. Pſal. 140.12. <hi>Thou wilt ſave the afflicted ſoul: I know that the Lord will maintain the cauſe of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.</hi> The Church in her complaint and prayer to God for help, ſpreads the greatneſſe of her affliction before him, <hi>Lament: per totum,</hi> (throughout the Book) and concludes ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us; conſider, and behold our reproach,</hi> Lament: 5.1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>When they are forſaken utterly,</hi> when all creature help failes and ceaſes. <hi>The LORD will judge his people, and repent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his ſervants, when he ſeeth that their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is gone, and there is none ſhut up, nor left,</hi> Deut: 32.36. And according to this word did the Lord do for <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for when there was not any ſhut up, nor any left, nor any helper for <hi>Iſrael, he ſaved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the ſon of Joaſh,</hi> 2 Kings 14.26, 27. And the efore God is ſaid to be the <hi>helper of the Fatherleſſe,</hi> Pſal. 10.14. <hi>And to regard the prayer of the deſtitute,</hi> Pſal. 102.17. <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſeeking help of God, urgeth him with their <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>deſtitute</hi> condition, 2 Chron: 20.12. ſaying, <hi>O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might againſt this great company
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42649:122"/> that cometh againſt us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> And to raiſe Gods Servants expectation of help from Chriſt in their <hi>loweſt eſtate,</hi> it is propheſied of him, Pſal. 72.4.12, 13. <hi>That he ſhall judge the poor of the people, he ſhall ſave the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the needy; he ſhall deliver the needy when he cryeth, the poor alſo, and him that hath no helper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>When they cry mightily to the LORD for help.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed time after time, <hi>they cryed to the Lord, and he delivered them;</hi> when the Lord hath a purpoſe to help his ſervants, he uſually <hi>poures</hi> forth a <hi>Spirit of Prayer upon them.</hi> When the Decree of releaſe from <hi>Babylon</hi> was ready to iſſue forth, God put a mighty <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> upon <hi>Daniel, Chap:</hi> 9. And immediately, before God will work, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſalvation for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he will <hi>ſpirit</hi> his ſervants to cry mightily unto him to do it for them, Iſa: 62.6, 7. <hi>I have ſet Watchmen upon thy walls, O Jeruſalem, which ſhall never hold their peace, day, nor night: ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not ſilence, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ve him no rest till he eſtabliſh, and till he make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth;</hi> ſo that when a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ghty Spirit of Prayer</hi> goes forth to engage Chriſt to help, he is not far from the help of his People.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:42649:122"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>When they beleeve on him ſtrongly:</hi> when Gods ſervants have reacht out an hand of faith towards him, he hath lifted up his hand to help them. <hi>Abraham</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſtrongly, and the Lord did help him greatly; <hi>Jehoſhaphat, Aſa, David,</hi> and others, relyed on the Lord, and were holpen in the time of their troubles; the <hi>three ſervants of God,</hi> mentioned <hi>Dan:</hi> 3. were of <hi>great faith,</hi> and Chriſt helped them, ſo that the <hi>fire burnt them not, neither could the flame kindle up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n them;</hi> yea, as many as ever came to Chriſt for help, either for body or ſoul, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all ſuch, as were of <hi>great faith</hi>) received it: and ſurely when the People of God ſtagger not at the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>help,</hi> but are ſtrong in faith, notwithſtanding many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and natural impoſſibilities before them, the Performance thereof is at hand. (Rom. 4.20.)</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>When they walk before him fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;</hi> nor doing their own, nor others, but his will. When the Servants of God of old did walk in their integrity, ſerving their Generations according to the will of God, he helped them and made their wayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous; but when they did put forth their hands unto iniquity, the LORD was not with them: There is none can expect that <hi>God ſhould meet them in a way of mercy</hi> and <hi>help,</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:42649:123"/> but <hi>ſuch as work righteouſneſſe,</hi> and all ſuch may, Iſa. 64.5. they can confidently pray for help in time of need, as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 119.173. <hi>Let thine hand help me, for I have choſen thy precepts.</hi> Chriſt promiſed and gave forth his help to his ſervants, when they were working his work in the ſimplicity and ſincerity of their ſouls; ſee his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Go ye, teach all Nations, bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>zing them in</hi> (or <hi>unto) the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to obſerve all things, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have commanded you; And lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</hi> So alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 21.12, 13, 14, 15. See like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his <hi>performance</hi> of his good word to them in their <hi>Preaching, Diſputing, Writing,</hi> Gal: 2.8. Acts 6.10. Acts 11.21. 2 Cor. 10.10. And certainly, as many as ſhall be <hi>faithfull</hi> to him in the work whereunto he calls them, ſhall receive a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of help to carry them through it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>When they uſe appointed means di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l gently;</hi> doing neither more, nor leſſe, nor any other thing than what God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of them. When the Lord of old had a urpoſe to help and ſave his People in an eminent way, he was wont to ſet them about doing ſomething; and ſometimes that which was very unlikely (as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42649:123"/> appearance) to further his intended work; yet when they were diligent in it, they were wonderfully helped, as might be ſhewn at large; ſo when Chriſt is in the way of the help and ſalvation of his people, he requireth ſomething that might ſeem a weak, fooliſh thing for them to do, which may ſeem in their eyes to be rather to their hurt, than help; yet they ought to be found uſing of it, and therein may expect Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him. When there was want of wine at the Marriage in <hi>Cana of Galilee, the Mother of Jeſus ſaid unto the ſervants, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſaith unto you, do it;</hi> which then they did, they were <hi>helped</hi> by him. (John 2.) When the Diſciples deſpairing of ſucceſs (having <hi>toiled all the night, and taken nothing</hi>) had given over fiſhing for that time, and were waſhing their Nets; he <hi>ſaid to Simon, Lanch out into the deep, and let down your Nets for a draught; at his word they did ſo; and when they had this done, they incloſed a great multitude of fiſhes.</hi> (Luke 5.4, 5.)</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>When enemies ſpeak proudly, act highly, and ſeem to bear down all before them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most ſecure and confident in their wayes;</hi> then Chriſt is not far from the help of his People. The Lord hath ſaid by the mouth of his Prophet, Iſa: 59.19, <hi>When the enemy ſhall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42649:124"/> LORD ſhall lift up a Standard againſt him.</hi> It was ſo of old, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was moſt proud and confident, and ſaid, <hi>I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoil, my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them, I will draw the ſword, my hand ſhall deſtroy them;</hi> then the Lord appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the help of his People againſt <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh,</hi> and all his Hoſt, (Exod. 15.8.) as he did in <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> time, when <hi>multitudes</hi> came againſt them, 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 20. as alſo in <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah's</hi> dayes, when the Adverſaries ſaid, <hi>They ſhall not know, neither ſee, till we come in the midſt among them, and ſlay them, and cauſe the work to ceaſe,</hi> Neh: 4.11, 12, 15. And as it was heretofore, ſo it ſhall be hereafter; For when <hi>Babylon ſaith in her heart,</hi> I <hi>ſit a Queen, and am no widdow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow,</hi> Then ſhall Chriſt the King of <hi>Sion,</hi> throw her down with violence, like a great <hi>Milſtone</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>the Sea,</hi> never to riſe again, (deſtroying her in a day, <hi>Rev:</hi> 18.7, 8.21.) and ſo free his Servants from all their oppreſſions; when men and Devils are raging, Chriſt will be helping.</p>
               <p>Thus I have anſwered the <hi>Queſtion</hi> by theſe ſeaven Particulars, which I deſire may be conſidered joyntly; for when theſe things concurre, when both the <hi>caſe</hi> and <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> of Gods People, as alſo of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is or ſhall be as hath been mentioned,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42649:124"/> 
                  <hi>help is at hand;</hi> they may then look up, and <hi>Lift up their heads, for their Redemption draweth nigh.</hi> (as <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> ſhould we make of this?</p>
               <p>Anſw: I. <hi>It is for Our INSTR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CTION,</hi> in <hi>Four Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It ſhews the Original, and firſt cauſe of Gods Servants help,</hi> namely, the <hi>LORD:</hi> For as their affliction, ſo their help cometh not forth out of the duſt, but from above, from the moſt High God: And as it is the choice priviledge of Gods People to find help in time of need; ſo it is their duty, and great advantage to know, and conſider from <hi>whence</hi> it cometh: And this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is an help to them therein; this did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 121.1, 2. <hi>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord which made Heaven and Earth;</hi> whoſoever be the <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> whatſoever be the <hi>means,</hi> help is from God alone; all <hi>Saviours</hi> and <hi>Salvations</hi> are from him. To this agreeth part of the <hi>Levites</hi> confeſſion of Gods goodneſſe to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Nehem: 9.27. <hi>According to thy manifold mercies thou gaveſt
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42649:125"/> them Saviours, who ſaved them out of the hand of their Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It ſhews a ſufficient ground and reaſon of the faith and hope that is in the Saints for help from Chriſt in time of need;</hi> He is mighty to help; but that is not all, it is the <hi>will and ordination of God that he ſhould help,</hi> He was both <hi>anointed and appointed thereunto,</hi> Iſa: 42.1, 6, 7. &amp; 61.1, 2, 3. Not onely <hi>anointed</hi> and <hi>enabled,</hi> but <hi>appointed</hi> alſo; and what God hath <hi>anointed</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> Chriſt to do, the Saints may <hi>beleeve, and hope for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It ſhews the righteouſneſſe, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, and goodneſſe of God in his commands to, and dealings with his people:</hi> He is no hard Maſter, looking <hi>to reap where he hath not ſown,</hi> nor <hi>to gather where he hath not ſtrawed;</hi> but as he hath appointed work for his people to do, and <hi>afflictions</hi> for them to endure, ſo he hath appointed and provided help for every imployment and condition.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It ſhews whence it is that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have been, and are able to do ſuch great things;</hi> it is not of, nor from themſelves, but from <hi>Chriſt their helper and help.</hi> It was the Lords b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To the prophane ones of the world, who inſult and triumph over Gods people, as</hi> if they were altogether <hi>helpleſs,</hi> and <hi>utterly forſaken;</hi> yea, they ſay concerning the Righteous, <hi>There is no help in God for him,</hi> Pſal: 3.2. <hi>God hath forſaken him; perſecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him,</hi> Pſal: 71.11. This <hi>Doctrine</hi> tells ſuch, that <hi>they lie,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak not the truth;</hi> and which is worſe, they make God a liar; for God hath ſworn it by his holineſs, <hi>that he will not lie herein,</hi> Pſal. 89.35, 19. and ſaith, <hi>I have laid help</hi> (and help <hi>enough,</hi> help) <hi>upon one that is mighty; and they ſay, there is no help for him.</hi> And thus do many <hi>contradict</hi> the Lord himſelfe; but they ſhall one day finde that God is true, and they are liars, (<hi>Jer:</hi> 44.28.) for God will performe every Good word which he hath ſpoken concerning the help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deliverance, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people, (as <hi>Joſ:</hi> 21.45. <hi>Joſ:</hi> 23.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To the proud ones of the earth, who truſt in themſelves, and in their own works for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> ſaying in their hearts, (though not with their tongues) that there is <hi>no need of the help of Chriſt,</hi> no need of his being made to them <hi>Wiſdome, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> (1 Cor: 1.30.) hereby <hi>fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the grace of God, and making the death of Chriſt of none effect,</hi> Gal: 2.21.

Let ſuch heare, and conſider what God ſpeaks to them, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 50.11. <hi>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compaſs your ſelves about with ſparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the ſparks that ye have kindled: this ſhall ye have of mine hand, ye ſhall lie downe in ſorrow.</hi> As alſo what Chriſt ſaith in his parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Two men went up into the Temple to pray, the one a Phariſee, and the other a Publican; The</hi> Phariſee <hi>ſtood, and prayed thus with himſelfe, God, I thanke thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt,

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This alſo reproves thoſe that truſt in their own ſtrength for preſervation and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from danger,</hi> that ſay in their hearts, <hi>We will deliver our ſelves,</hi> our own ſwords ſhall ſave us; as alſo thoſe that conceit their own hands ſufficient for their deſignes.

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Thoſe that deſpaire of eternal ſalvation;</hi> and they are</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Either GREAT SINNERS,</hi> ſuch as have ſinned ſo long, ſo much, and ſo grievouſly, that they conclude their iniquitie is <hi>greater</hi> than <hi>can</hi> be forgive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Why ſhould any <hi>deſpaire of help</hi> from <hi>him, who is</hi> not onely <hi>able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him,</hi> (Heb: 7.25.) but is alſo <hi>appointed</hi> of God thereunto, (<hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or WEAK SAINTS,</hi> ſuch have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>ſaid, that there is no help in Chriſt for them;</hi>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42649:127"/> but that they ſhall <hi>periſh</hi> in their Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and fall, at laſt, by the hand of <hi>ſome</hi> Temptation or other. But <hi>how injurious</hi> are ſuch to the <hi>grace</hi> of God, and their <hi>own</hi> ſoules; not conſidering, that <hi>God laid help upon</hi> his ſervant <hi>David</hi> for <hi>all Iſrael,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the <hi>weak of the flock;</hi> yea, becauſe his people are weak, and that they might not truſt in themſelves, but in <hi>Chriſt, he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> him <hi>to be an help for them,</hi> (1 Tim: 1.15. Rom: 4.5.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe that deſpaire of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or any promiſed proſperous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And this is when Gods people have prayed much, and waited long in a <hi>low</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> eſtate, and the mercy ſeemes as far off at laſt, as it was at firſt; and the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God ſeemes to run croſſe to his promiſe. Thus it was with the <hi>children of Iſrael,</hi> Ezek: 37.11. <hi>Behold, they ſay, our bones are dried, and our hope is loſt, we are cut off for our parts.</hi> But why ſhould Gods people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire in this reſpect, God can <hi>open their graves,</hi> and cauſe <hi>them to come up out of their graves,</hi> (verſ: 12.) He hath appointed a Mighty one to be an help to them, a Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Saviour and deliverer, who can deliver them when they are at the <hi>loweſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Thoſe that ſeek and look to others for help in time of trouble,</hi> as the manner of moſt
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42649:128"/> is, <hi>and neglect Chriſt;</hi> that cry to the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and wiſe ones of the Earth, help us, ſave us; To ſuch I ſay,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It's in vaine to go to the Creature for help,</hi> for help is not to be found in it; The wiſeſt, mightieſt, richeſt, and honourableſt, man on earth muſt ſay, as the <hi>King of Iſrael</hi> to the <hi>Woman of Samaria,</hi> crying to him for help, ſaying, <hi>Help my Lord, O King: If the LORD do not help thee, whence ſhall I help thee?</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.26, 27. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> cryes out once, and againe, <hi>Vaine is the help of man, (Pſal:</hi> 60.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 108.12.) The Children of <hi>Iſrael went downe to Egypt for help,</hi> but they were a people that could not profit them, nor be an help, but <hi>a ſhame and reproach,</hi> Iſa: 30.2, 5. If the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> go and <hi>cry unto the Gods,</hi> unto whom they offered <hi>Incenſe,</hi> they ſhall <hi>not ſave them at all in time of their trouble,</hi> Jer: 11.12. <hi>Populous No was ſituate among the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and had the waters round about her, the <hi>Sea was her Rampart, and her wall was from the Sea; Ethiopia and Egypt were her ſtrength, Put and Lubim were her helpers, yet ſhe was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away,</hi> ſhe went <hi>into Captivity,</hi> Nah: 3.8, 9, 10. The Church acknowledgeth, and bewaileth her fault and condition in this reſpect, <hi>Lament:</hi> 4.17. ſaying, <hi>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vaine help, in our watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42649:128"/> we have watched for a Nation that could not ſave us.</hi> And what is more common and ordinary, than for thoſe that conceit, and look to receive help from Creatures, to meet with diſappointments, and to finde by experience that they <hi>imagine a vaine thing.</hi> I ſhall conclude this particular with that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Affirmation, <hi>Jer:</hi> 3.23. <hi>Truly in vaine is ſalvation hoped for from the hils, and from the multitude of Mountaines; truly in the Lord our God is the ſalvation of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; <hi>It is not onely in vaine,</hi> but <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous alſo;</hi> greatly to the hurt and loſſe of thoſe that flee to the Creature for help: For the Lord will not onely not help, but he is thereby provoked to come againſt ſuch, and their helpers too, to cauſe them all to fall; And therefore there is a <hi>Woe</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt ſuch, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 30.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31.1. <hi>Wo to them that go downe to Egypt for help, to ſtrengthen themſelves in the ſtrength of Pharaoh: Iſrael</hi> ſought for help from <hi>Egypt,</hi> but received hurt; hence God tells the Inhabitants of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that <hi>they have been a ſtaffe of reed to the houſe of Iſrael. When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didſt break, and rent all their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakeſt, and madeſt all their loins to be at a ſtand,</hi> Ezek: 29.6, 7. If <hi>Ahaziah</hi> neglect the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in his ſickneſs,</hi> and ſeek help from <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42649:129"/> the God of Ekron,</hi> God will meet with him for it, And <hi>he ſhall not come downe from the bed on which he went up, but ſhall ſurely die,</hi> 2 King, 1.2, 4. <hi>Ahaz in his ſtraits</hi> ſent to the King of <hi>Aſſyria to help him;</hi> but he received harme, in ſtead of help; for, it is ſaid, <hi>he came unto him, and diſtreſſed him, but ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him not.</hi> And <hi>Ahaz</hi> took away a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of the houſe of the Lord, and out of the houſe of the King, and of the Princes, and gave it unto the King of <hi>Aſſyria; but he helped him not;</hi> and miſſing of help from him, he betook himſelfe to <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> he <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to the Gods of Damaſcus,</hi> which ſmote him, and ſaid, <hi>becauſe the Gods of the Kings of Syria help them, therefore will I ſacrifice to them, that they may help me;</hi> but they alſo were far from helping him, <hi>For they were the ruine of him, and of all Iſrael,</hi> 2 Chron: 28.16, 20, 21, 23. And thus will it fare with the man, that (neglecting the help of Chriſt) <hi>truſteth in man,</hi> and <hi>maketh fleſh his Arme,</hi> (Jer: 17.5.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is ſinfull, VERY SINF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LL;</hi> Such (like to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of whom God greatly complaines, <hi>Jer:</hi> 2.12, 13.) <hi>commit two great evils at once, they forſake the Lord</hi> Chriſt, the Saviour, and the Great one, whom God hath appointed for their help, <hi>and choſe to themſelves Creatures,</hi> weak Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42649:129"/> 
                     <hi>that can afford no help. The greatneſs of this evil conſiſts chiefly in THREE THINGS.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is a deſpiſing the riches of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> In this was manifeſted the greatneſs of the love, and the <hi>riches</hi> of the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God to his people, that he <hi>appointed</hi> his onely begotten Son to be an help for them; and now for them to refuſe his help, and to ſeek to others for help, is a <hi>deſpiſing of the riches of Gods goodneſs,</hi> and that is no little evil, (<hi>Rom:</hi> 2.4, 5.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It is alſo a ſlighting of Chriſt;</hi> yea it is highly diſhonourable to Chriſt, whom God hath appointed to help. It is not onely a preferring others before him, but it is a ſetting by this <hi>Mighty One,</hi> as <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> and a making uſe of others as <hi>ſufficient</hi> to help; This was <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin, in <hi>asking a King</hi> to reigne over them, when <hi>God was their King; They ſlighted the Lord:</hi> Hence ſaid the Lord to <hi>Samuel, they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reigne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them,</hi> 1 Sam: 8.7. And <hi>Samuel</hi> charged it home upon them, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 10.19. <hi>Ye have this day rejected your God, who himſelfe ſaved you out of all your adverſities, and your tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ye have ſaid unto him, nay but ſet a King over us.</hi> It is no little ſin <hi>to tread under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot the Son of God,</hi> Heb: 10.29.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Further, it is a walking contrary
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42649:130"/> to profeſſion.</hi> Upon this account <hi>Ezra</hi> would not ſeek to the Creature for help againſt the enemy, which did lie in wait by the way, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.21, 22. He <hi>betook</hi> himſelfe to the <hi>Lord,</hi> to <hi>ſeek of him a right way for him, and his companions, and their little ones, and all their ſubſtance. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I was aſhamed to require of the King a band of Souldiers, and Horſmen to help us against the Enemy in the way; becauſe we had ſpoken unto the King, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that ſeek him.</hi> Becauſe it was <hi>contrary to his profeſſion,</hi> he ſought not help from the King. For men to call Chriſt LORD, and acknowledge him to be King, the Saviour, helper, redeemer, and deliverer of all thoſe that truſt in him; and yet to look to the hils, and the mountaines for help and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is to walk contrary to their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and that is a great evil alſo.</p>

But here is the <hi>Comfort</hi> of the Righteous, they are not left alone to encounter with theſe <hi>Giants; Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of ſalvation</hi> ſtands at their right hand to help them, (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 109.31.) If the <hi>Devil</hi> ſtirre up <hi>Mighty Ones</hi> to hate, and perſecute Gods ſervants; <hi>God</hi> (anſwerable thereunto) hath appointed a <hi>Mighty One,</hi> yea a Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier than they, to be an <hi>help</hi> to his people.

Chriſt the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> is at hand to help and deliver them, (<hi>Zac:</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Rev:</hi> 5.5.) It is the high priviledge of the Church of the living God, that Chriſt, the appointed helper thereof, is <hi>mightier to ſave,</hi> than the Devil, and all enemies are to deſtroy, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 63.1. Yea, the very <hi>weakneſs</hi> of their Mighty helper and Saviour is <hi>ſtronger</hi> than their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, (1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 1.25, 27.) They may boldly ſay, <hi>the Lord is our Helper, we will not feare what man ſhall do unto us,</hi> Heb: 13.6.

According to this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Phil:</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth me;</hi> Surely it muſt needs be matter of great joy and <hi>comfort</hi> to Gods fearing and trembling ſervants, becauſe of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to heare of, and experience ſuch an alſufficiency of help, as is in Chriſt for them.</p>

If the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> he intend to uſe in his work be <hi>dull,</hi> he can <hi>ſharpen</hi> them; He can make the <hi>Worm Jacob,</hi> a <hi>new ſharp threſhing Inſtrument having teeth, to threſh the Mountaines, and beat them
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42649:132"/> ſmall,</hi> Iſa: 41.14, 15. And if the <hi>iron</hi> be <hi>blunt,</hi> and he do whet the <hi>edge,</hi> he hath ſo much <hi>ſtrength</hi> to put to, as he can make it do <hi>execution,</hi> to cut aſunder, what he will have cut aſunder; <hi>It is nothing with him to help, whether with many, or with few, or with them that have no power,</hi> (2 Chron: 14.11.) Therefore let the ſervants of Chriſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and encouraged in the <hi>Mightineſs</hi> of their Lord to help, though they ſee nothing but fooliſh, weak, baſe, and deſpiſed things in his hand to make uſe of for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Its the manner of Chriſt (and he gets honour thereby) to help by ſuch things; he hath <hi>choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe; and the weak things of the world, to confound the things that are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed, yea things which are not, to bring to nought, things that are,</hi> (1 Cor: 1.27.) The <hi>Mightineſs</hi> of the <hi>Agent,</hi> is an <hi>encouragement</hi> againſt the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the <hi>meanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But many put away from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves this breaſt of conſolation, and object against this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some ſaying, <hi>they are not worthy that Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iſt ſhould help them;</hi> And though God hath appointed him to be an help to his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42649:132"/> people, yet he will not ariſe to the help of ſuch obſtinate and rebellious ones as they have been, and are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>a free, undeſerved</hi> help, and none of thoſe whoſe help he hath been, were <hi>ever worthy</hi> of it; But he hath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred his people in their <hi>low</hi> eſtate; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them from many enemies, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; not becauſe of their merits, but becauſe his mercy endureth for ever. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were a rebellious, and ſtiffnecked people, and yet the Lord ſaved, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them many a time. And the Lords hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave; nor his goodneſs abated, that he ſhould not ſtill help his people, notwithſtanding their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some ſay, <hi>that they are of fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, diſcontented, and peeviſh ſpirits under trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Afflictions; and Chriſt will not help ſuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such a frame and carriage of any of the ſervants of Chriſt, muſt needs be a griefe, and trouble to his ſoule; but yet their hope of help from him in time of need, is not hereby cut off. The <hi>children of Iſrael</hi> were a <hi>froward, murmuring</hi> generation, and yet the <hi>moſt high God was their help</hi> from time to time; The <hi>tender-hearted mother</hi> is as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſuccour, and help her <hi>froward,</hi> diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42649:133"/> child, that <hi>cryes</hi> night and day, as the <hi>reſt</hi> of her children: And ſurely <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and help extends as farre as any <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> on earth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some ſay, <hi>That Chriſt hath helped us often, we have wearied him, he will help no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It proves oft ſo in reſpect of men; but in reſpect of Chriſt it is not ſo: He is an helper that <hi>fainteth</hi> not, <hi>neither can he be weary,</hi> (Iſa: 40.28.) And though men think when they have done a little for their followers, that they have done enough, and they muſt not trouble them too often; yet the Servants of Chriſt may go as often as they will to him for help, and be alwayes welcome, ſo they do not abuſe his grace towards them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Chriſts former, frequent helping of his People in their ſeveral ſtraits, is ſo far from containing any thing againſt his helping them for the future, that it is an <hi>Argument</hi> to prove, <hi>that he will continue his help to them;</hi> and according to this <hi>David</hi> argued, 1 Sam: 17.37. <hi>The Lord that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me out of the paw of the Lyon, and out of the paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philiſtim.</hi> He did not ſay, God hath d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>livered me ſeveral times, he will deliver
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42649:133"/> me no more; but the contrary, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth the ſame Argument, 2 Cor. 1.10. 2 Tim: 4.17.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some, <hi>That Chriſt indeed did help when on earth, but he is NOW IN HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN, HE WILL HELP NO MORE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though Chriſt be in Heaven, yet he is as neer to help his Servants, as when he was on Earth; there is nothing in his being in Heaven, whereby they ſhould fear he will not help: For by HIS BEING <hi>in Heaven,</hi> conſider</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>He is not diſenabled to help;</hi> for there <hi>Angels &amp; Authorities are made ſubject unto him,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.22. If Chriſt were ſo mighty to help when in a ſtate of <hi>Humiliation;</hi> how mighty to help and ſave muſt he needs be now he is <hi>ſet on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens?</hi> (Heb: 8.1.) He can help them againſt all enemies, he can rain down fire and brimſtone, ſtorm and tempeſt upon them; he can help them againſt <hi>all outward wants,</hi> for from on high he can ſend down ſhowres of bleſſings, as rain upon his Inheritance; he can help them <hi>alſo againſt all ſpirituall wants,</hi> he can ſend the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42649:134"/> which ſhall guide them into all Truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By his Being in Heaven, <hi>He is not diſaffected towards them:</hi> his heart turned not from them by his going to Heaven; but though he be cloathed with glory, yet he is full of bowels; the ſame Spirit that acted him here below, reſts upon him, and abides with him for ever. Though there be a great alteration in his condition, being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from Earth to Heaven, from ſhame to glory; yet there is no change in his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he is as pitiful and merciful to his People as ever, (Heb: 2.17, 18, &amp; 4.15. with 5.2.) and therefore his Servants may now, as well as heretofore, expect help from him in time of need.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By his being in Heaven, <hi>He is not diſengaged from helping them.</hi> The Lord God appointed him to be an help to his People <hi>now he is in Heaven, as well as when he was on Earth.</hi> And as Chriſt did on Earth what was to be done for them here, ſo now he is in Heaven, he is there to do what is yet to be done for them; what he begun to work here, he is to finiſh there, (John 14.2. John 16.7.—15.) God made him a Prieſt for ever and that for the help of his People, and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them,</hi> Heb:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42649:134"/> 7.25. The ſame Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That he is entred into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb: 9.24.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>He is not thereby diſ-intereſted in them, nor they in him.</hi> Chriſts being in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven doth not deſtroy thoſe neer Relations that are between Chriſt and his People; he is ſtill a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and they his ſheep; ſtill an <hi>Husband,</hi> and they his <hi>Spouſe;</hi> he is ſtill their <hi>Head,</hi> and they his <hi>Members;</hi> he is ſtill their <hi>Brother, Friend, Father,</hi> neither are theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations onely abiding, but are in their <hi>full vigour</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> he being a more <hi>glorious Head, Husband, Friend,</hi> than when on earth; the abiding of theſe Relations ſpeak forth his helping of his People.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>He is not diſregardful of them by his being in Heaven.</hi> Some may be ready to ſay, he is at Gods right hand, he is in glory; and though he be not diſaffected towards us, yet he being ſo far above us, may forget, and <hi>diſregard us in our low eſtate;</hi> but it is not with Chriſt, as with corrupt man; his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advancement doth not puff him, nor make him proud; but though he be in his high eſtate, at the right hand of God, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers being made ſubject unto him, yet he doth regard, and help his Servants in their <hi>low</hi> eſtate. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42649:135"/> Chriſt, yet he was then mindful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of weak helpleſſe ſouls, earneſtly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and</hi> I <hi>will give you rest,</hi> Math. 11.27, 28. with 28.18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>He is not diſſwaded from helping them, being in Heaven.</hi> There is none there againſt his Servants, that ſhould ſeek to take him off from helping them; the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> who hath committed all things into his hands, is well pleaſed with it, being alſo full of compaſſion towards thoſe that are in diſtreſs. The <hi>Angels</hi> alſo, thoſe miniſtring Spirits rejoyce at it, and are ready at his word to go forth to miniſter for the Heirs of ſalvation. (Heb. 1.14.)</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Neither is he</hi> (being in Heaven) <hi>any way damnified, nor diſadvantaged by helping his Servants on Earth;</hi> he hath not the leſſe by what he giveth to them; he is not the weaker by what he doth for them, but he gaineth by his layings out upon them; the more he <hi>ſoweth,</hi> the more he <hi>reapeth;</hi> the more he <hi>gives</hi> forth of grace and help to them, the more he <hi>receives</hi> of love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from them.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, that there is no cauſe why the Saints ſhould doubt of the help of Chriſt becauſe he is in Heaven, but that they
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42649:135"/> ſhould the more confidently expect it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he liveth there to help them.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In caſe of ſickneſs and diſeaſes.</hi> This the Lord commandeth by his Servant <hi>James,</hi> and encourageth to by a gracious promiſe of help in that reſpect, James 5.14, 15. <hi>Is any ſick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oyl the Name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up.</hi> And this was the <hi>Primitive</hi> Practice, both Saints and People committed their <hi>bodyes</hi> to him, and were holpen, he healed them all, yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were healed, and many ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were done by the Name of Gods <hi>holy Child Jeſus,</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes, (Acts 4.30. Acts 8.5, 7. &amp; 3.6.) and therefore let us commit our bodies to this Mighty One; let us make him our Phyſitian, he is able to help and heal.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>In caſe of ſufferings.</hi> When you be called to ſuffer in your bodies, whether ſtripes, buffetings, impriſonments, hunger,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42649:137"/> thirſt, cold, nakedneſſe, or death for the ſake of Chriſt; be not fearful nor careful, but commit your bodyes (and every part thereof) to him, who is mighty to help in this reſpect alſo; both to prepare, fit, and ſtrengthen the body for the enduring theſe, and the like afflictions, and alſo to keep it that it ſhall not be loſt, nor periſh in any of its ſufferings, (no, not a hair or bone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (<hi>Phil:</hi> 3.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.20.) but though it dye, it ſhall live again, he will raiſe it in power and glory, (1 Cor. 15.43.) and therefore men are ſaid only to kill the body, not utterly to deſtroy it. (Mat. 10.28.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Commit your Eſtates to him.</hi> He is able, and he will either keep your eſtates for you, (as ſome of his Servants who have been willing to part with them, have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, whileſt others diſtruſting, and not committing them into his hands, but ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave them, have loſt them,) or if you <hi>part</hi> with them for his ſake, he will help you to <hi>live</hi> of a <hi>little,</hi> yea, to live more <hi>comfortably</hi> of a little, than you did of a great deal; <hi>he will make your little that you have in a way of righteouſneſs, better than great Revenues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out right,</hi> Pro: 16.8.

Yea, the time is a coming, when he will take away <hi>the reproach and rebuke of his people from off all the earth, and make them a

What though <hi>Truth and Righteouſneſſe be fallen in the ſtreets,</hi> and ſeem to lye dead and buried, and almoſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by many? yea, what though inſtead of <hi>Truth</hi> there be <hi>Errour,</hi> inſtead of <hi>holineſſe</hi> there be <hi>prophaneſſe,</hi> inſtead of <hi>judgement</hi> there be <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> and inſtead of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> a <hi>cry;</hi> yet he is <hi>able</hi> to raiſe up his own Cauſe, and will do it; <hi>For he ſhall not fail, nor be diſcouraged, till he have ſet judgement; yea, till he have eſtabliſhed Truth and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 42.4. Therefore let none of the followers of Chriſt be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if at any time the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of their Lord do not proſper in their hands, according to the deſires of their hearts, but commit it to him to mannage, who is <hi>wonderful in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and excellent in working,</hi> (Iſa. 28.29.)
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42649:138"/> This did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 74.22. ſaying, <hi>Ariſe O God, plead thy own cauſe.</hi> As alſo <hi>Luther,</hi> who was wont to ſay when the Cauſe of God was low in his hand, <hi>It is Gods Cauſe, let him look to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Commit</hi> YOUR OWN CAUSE <hi>to him.</hi> Other Mighty ones may be neglect and condemn <hi>your</hi> Righteous Cauſe; this <hi>Mighty One,</hi> the Lord Chriſt, who <hi>is higher than the higheſt,</hi> regardeth, and pleadeth the Cauſe of his People, yea, he will <hi>throughly plead</hi> their cauſe. In confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this grace of God, the Church of old reſolving to be quiet under the preſent diſpenſation, <hi>committed</hi> her cauſe to the Lord, as appears from thoſe words recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Micah 7.8, 9. <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him, untill he plead my Cauſe, and execute judgement for me; he will bring me forth to the light, and I ſhall behold his righteouſneſſe; then ſhe that is mine enemy ſhall ſee it, and ſhame ſhall cover her which ſaid unto me, Where is the Lord thy God?</hi> When <hi>Davids</hi> enemies digged pits for his ſoul, and rejoyced over him wrongfully, and deviſed deceitfull matters againſt them that were quiet in the Land, and opened their mouth wide againſt him, ſaying, <hi>Aha, aha, our eye hath ſeen it.</hi> He commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his cauſe to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.22, 23.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42649:139"/> 
                     <hi>This thou hast ſeen, O Lord, keep not ſilence; O Lord, be not far from me, ſtir up thy ſelfe, and awake to my judgement, even unto my cauſe, my God, and my Lord.</hi> Thus did <hi>Jeremy</hi> alſo when his enemies deviſed devices againſt him, <hi>Jeremy.</hi> 11.20. &amp; 20.10, 11, 12. Let then the upright Ones of the earth, when they are oppreſſed and wronged by the wicked of the world, be of good cheer, and not faint in their minds, but <hi>commit all</hi> to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is Mighty to clear and juſtifie them, and to take vengeance for them.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Commit your</hi> WORK <hi>to him.</hi> All your work and way, eſpecially your difficult work wherein you moſt need his help, look for it, God hath appointed him to be an help, and he is free to help, yea to <hi>work all your works in you, and FOR you.</hi> (Iſa: 26.12.)</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>Commit your</hi> CONDITIONS <hi>to him;</hi> Yea, let all, both the <hi>Wicked</hi> and the <hi>Righteous,</hi> both <hi>Sinners</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their conditions to him.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>SINNERS,</hi> Commit <hi>your Conditions to him,</hi> that you may not periſh in your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; he onely can help you.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There is no other name under Heaven given among men, whereby you can be ſaved,</hi> (Acts 4.12.) Neither is there need of any
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42649:139"/> other, foraſmuch as <hi>he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him.</hi> (Heb. 6.7.) And therefore haſten away from the Devil, world, and your own ſelves, and all vanities, leſt they be your ruine; and <hi>commit your Conditions to him,</hi> and you ſhall find help and healing of all your wounds, and in the end everlaſting life, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Are you laden with ſin?</hi> ſo that you <hi>cannot look up</hi> with any confidence or cheerfulneſſe of ſpirit, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12.) <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair not,</hi> do not ſay, <hi>There is hope:</hi> (as <hi>Jer:</hi> 2.25.) Chriſt hath both power to forgive, and deſtroy ſin; his blood can cleanſe from all ſin, Mat. 11.28. 1 John 1.7, 9. His Spirit can crucifie the fleſh, with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and luſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11, 13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Are you ignorant of the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> Do you ſit in great darkneſs? God hath given him to be a Light to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> to open the blind eyes, (Iſa. 42.6, 7.) and he can make you that are darkneſſe, light in the Lord, (as thoſe in <hi>Eph:</hi> 5.8.) him ſelf hath ſaid, <hi>That he is the light of the world, and he that followeth him ſhall not walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but ſhall have the light of Life,</hi> John 8.12.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Are you the Devils Captives and Slaves to do his will?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt can deliver you from that ſervitude alſo, he can turn
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42649:140"/> you (as he hath others) from the power of Satan unto God, (Acts 26.18.) to be his Servants, and Sons, bleſſed for ever: Yea, <hi>however</hi> it is with you, he can help you; therefore to day while it is called to day, while he tenders his help and ſalvation, do not neglect it, leſt hereafter when you call, and cry to him for it, he refuſe to hear you at all, (<hi>Heb:</hi> 2.3. &amp; 3.7.—11. <hi>Prov:</hi> 1.22, 23, 24.)</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>SAINTS, Commit your Conditions to him alſo;</hi> your moſt afflictive Conditions, <hi>Caſt all your burthens upon him,</hi> according to that word, Pſal. 5.22. <hi>Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Commit your O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TWARD CONDITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS to him,</hi> all your bodily concernments and troubles; As</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Your <hi>Poverty,</hi> and <hi>low eſtate,</hi> as it is ſaid Pſal. 10.14. <hi>The poor committeth himſelf to thee, thou art the helper of the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</hi> It is the work of this Mighty One <hi>to deliver the needy when he cryeth, the poor alſo, and him that hath no helper,</hi> (Pſal. 72.12.)</p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:42649:140"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Your oppreſſions and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, he can deliver from them, he can and will burſt every band, and take off eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yoke, and alſo break in pieces the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.4.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, All the troubles and burthens of your ſpirits, which are moſt heavy, and hard to bear, as it is written, <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Prov: 18.14. Make uſe of the arm of Chriſt, which he ſtretcheth out for your help, your ſouls ſupport, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and <hi>come to him</hi> (according to his gracious invitation) <hi>all you that are weary and heavy laden, and he will give you rest,</hi> (Mat. 11. at the end) and you ſhall find help in every time of need. (Heb: 4.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Are you <hi>ſuch as the Devil tempteth, and thruſts ſore against, that you might fall?</hi> Commit that condition to Chriſt, that he may be your helper therein, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is <hi>appointed</hi> of God; and <hi>in that himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb: 2.18. And to <hi>keep you from falling. (Jude</hi> 24.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Have you been overcome by the Tempter?</hi> Still look unto Chriſt who is <hi>mighty to recover you</hi> out of the ſnare of the Devil, &amp; to raiſe you up again, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.)</p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:42649:141"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Are you men and women of ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpirits, and full of heavineſſe? Lye at the feet of him whom God hath ſent to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for aſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the oyl of joy for mourning, the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſſe,</hi> Iſa. 61.2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Do you find a Combate within you, the fleſh luſting against the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh,</hi> ſo that you are hindred <hi>from doing the good you would, Gal.</hi> 5.17. and ſometimes <hi>brought into captivity to the Law of ſin,</hi> that you even cry out like wretched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done men, <hi>Who ſhall deliver us from the body of this death?</hi> Rom: 7.19, 23, 24. <hi>Commit this</hi> condition to Chriſt alſo, who <hi>is able to ſubdue</hi> your corruptions, and to ſet your ſouls above your <hi>luſts,</hi> and to make you (as he did <hi>Paul</hi>) victorious over all evil; ſo that you ſhall ſay with him in the like conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>We thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom: 7.25. 1 Cor: 15.57.</p>
                  <p>USE. <hi>Put your ſelves into Chriſts ſervice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are TWO THINGS uſually <hi>diſcourage</hi> ſouls from Chriſts worke; the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42649:141"/> 
                     <hi>Mightineſſe of Christ</hi> to help, doth encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age againſt both.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>DIFFIC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LTY:</hi> Chriſts ſervice is apprehended to <hi>be hard and difficult;</hi> and the ſoul that is ſometimes ſomewhat inclined to it, doth ordinarily put it off with theſe or the like arguings, <hi>I cannot perform it, if I ſhould undertake it; if I ſhould profeſs Chriſt,</hi> I <hi>ſhall not hold faſt my profeſſion, but diſhonour him by apoſtacy; if I ſhould name his Name, and not depart from iniquity, I had better make no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him: I know I ſhall never be able to pray as others do, nor ſo to learn, nor underſtand the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdome, nor to deny my ſelf, and forſake all for Chriſt; and therefore I had as good abide a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> I am, and not mind things that are TOO high and HARD for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You know what <hi>Anſwer</hi> Chriſt made to his Diſciples in the like caſe, Math. 19.26. <hi>With men this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible.</hi> And though of your ſelves, as of your ſelves you are not ſufficient for the leaſt of thoſe things, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.) yet through the help of Chriſt, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them all, he can make the dulleſt to underſtand, and the weakeſt mighty to do his will, and it is his work to <hi>ſtrengthen the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees, and to make them that are of a fearfull heart, bold and ſtrong;</hi> yea, he performeth all things for
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42649:142"/> his Servants: And thus through Chriſt ſtrengthning of them, they experience his <hi>burthen</hi> to be <hi>light,</hi> and his <hi>yoke eaſie,</hi> Mat. 11.29. Therefore let not the thoughts, nor fears of difficulty hold any off from Chriſts ſervice, ſeeing he is ſo <hi>able to help.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The other Diſcouragement <hi>DANGER:</hi> He that engageth in Chriſts work heartily and throughly, expoſeth himſelf to <hi>danger,</hi> (as ſome men count dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) his <hi>Name, Liberty, Eſtate,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> it ſelf is in danger of being loſt; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe things keeps off many from profeſſing and ſerving Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pure, and glorious Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But to <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But what though dangers be many, and great, it is enough to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to his work, that Jeſus Chriſt is a <hi>Great One,</hi> and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> mighty to help, and deliver in, and out of dangers: it was dangerous in the eyes of men for <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> not to worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It was dangerous for <hi>Daniel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Kings Decree, to pray three times a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42649:142"/> day,</hi> his Windows being open in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for he was caſt into the <hi>Lions den,</hi> and yet he was ſafe there; God ſent his <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>ſhut the Lions mouths,</hi> ſo that no manner of hurt was found upon him, <hi>Dan:</hi> 6.10. It was <hi>dangerous</hi> alſo for <hi>Eſther</hi> to go in to the King, contrary to <hi>Law;</hi> And yet it made way both for her <hi>own,</hi> and her <hi>peoples</hi> preſervation, and ſafety. It was <hi>dangerous</hi> likewiſe for the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>primitive</hi> Saints, to preach, and practiſe, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to the <hi>commands</hi> of the <hi>Rulers,</hi> and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the people: And yet Jeſus Chriſt being with them, according to his promiſe to help and ſtrengthen them in their work, they did wonderfully prevaile, and proſper, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.18, 19, 20, 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.17, 18, 19, 20-28, 29-38, 40, 41, 42.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let not <hi>feare of danger hinder any</hi> from yeelding up themſelves to the ſervice of Chriſt. And you that are ſo carefull to <hi>avoyd</hi> danger, conſider that you <hi>bring</hi> your ſelves into the <hi>greateſt</hi> danger, by declining his work. While you ſeek to <hi>ſave your ſelves,</hi> you looſe your ſouls and ſelves; While you ſtudy to eſcape the danger of <hi>mans</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and wrath, you fall into <hi>danger</hi> of the diſpleaſure of the moſt <hi>high God,</hi> yea into danger of eternal Damnation, (<hi>Math:</hi> 16.25, 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34-38.)</p>

Chriſts help is not to <hi>indulge</hi> the fleſh, but to <hi>quicken</hi> the dull ſpirits of his ſervants. Yea the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>help of Christ,</hi> is ſo farre from being a principle of <hi>looſneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſlothfulneſs,</hi> as that it <hi>engageth,</hi> and worketh up the ſoules of thoſe that do underſtand it aright, unto a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, vigorous, and cheerfull performance of the will of God.

But ſoule, take heed thou doſt not <hi>exclude</hi> thy ſelfe from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Chriſts help, which extends to <hi>all Zion,</hi> to the <hi>whole flock,</hi> to the <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ſick,</hi> as well as to the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>ſound;</hi> yea eſpecially to the <hi>weak;</hi> according to that good word of the Lord, <hi>Ezek:</hi> 34.15, 16. <hi>I will feed my flock, and I will cauſe them to lie downe, ſaith the Lord God, I will ſeek that which was loſt, and bring againe that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will ſtrengthen that which was ſick;</hi> yea, it is ſaid of him, <hi>He ſhall gather the lambs with his Arm, and carry them in his boſom, and ſhall gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead thoſe that are with young,</hi> Iſa: 40.11. Therefore do not <hi>limit this</hi> holy One in any wiſe.</p>
               <p>Uſe. <hi>Seek to Chriſt for help in every time of need;</hi> whilſt others are looking and ſeeking to Creatures like to themſelves, for help, and can finde none, their eyes failing for their vaine help; do you look to him who is both <hi>Mighty,</hi> and <hi>ordained</hi> of God to help, and then you ſhall be ſure to finde; when you <hi>ſeek with your whole heart, (Jer:</hi> 29.13. <hi>Pſal:</hi> 20.7, 8.) He is the great helper, and Saviour, and there is <hi>none can help like him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None ſo Authoritatively,</hi> he, having all
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42649:145"/> power both in heaven and earth, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth deliverances for <hi>Jacob,</hi> Pſal: 44.4.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None ſo tenderly,</hi> and compaſſionately; In his love, and in his pity, he redeemeth, and ſaveth his people, (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 63.9.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None ſo ſeaſonably;</hi> he is a very preſent help in time of trouble, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.5.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None ſo conſtantly;</hi> he is an help for ever, (<hi>Pſal:</hi> 12.7.) therefore ſeek to him above all others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And having found help from him in time of need, be ſure you carry it well towards him,</hi> let your Converſation to him-ward be as becometh this grace; be eſpecially carefull,</p>
               <p>Firſt, To <hi>SERVE HIM THE MORE FREELY;</hi> he both deſerves, and expects it at your hands; had you found him, either unwilling, or unable to ayd you, you might have had ſome plea for your backwardneſs to ſerve him, but ſeeing he hath been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſſiſt you in every buſineſs, how ought you to be ready to anſwer when he calls, to go when he bids you go, and to do what he bids you do, and that with a willing, and cheerfull ſpirit? Let your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his help, make you forward to his work, <hi>ſo</hi> ſhall you finde, that <hi>he that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42649:145"/> hath holpen, will help,</hi> and he that <hi>hath ſaved,</hi> is <hi>ſtill mighty to ſave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, To <hi>CLEAVE TO HIM CONSTANTLY;</hi> It will be your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and greateſt ſafety to ſtick to him whom you know to be both mighty, and faithfull; oh, <hi>forſake not him in</hi> any <hi>condition,</hi> whom <hi>you have found an help in</hi> every <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, To <hi>PRAISE HIM CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ALLY;</hi> make him evermore your ſong, who hath been alwayes your ſtrength, (<hi>Iſa:</hi> 12.3. <hi>Iſa:</hi> 38.20.) This did <hi>David,</hi> as appeares, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 71.6. <hi>By thee have I been holden up from the womb, thou art he that took me out of my mothers bowels; my praiſe ſhall be continually of thee:</hi> Yea, give him all the glory of all <hi>your</hi> works, which are indeed rather <hi>his</hi> than <hi>yours,</hi> being wrought by his ſtrength and help. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> carriage, as in other things, ſo in this, is worthy of imitation, who when they had wrought <hi>miracles</hi> by <hi>Chriſts</hi> power, were carefull to give <hi>all</hi> the glory to his Name, (as <hi>Acts</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.13, 14-18, &amp;c.) The like we reade of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>fifth,</hi> who after he had obtained a great Victory, ſaid, <hi>I have Conquered in the Name of Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> I ſhall onely ſay, <hi>Go you, and do likewiſe;</hi> for <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlaine, to receive power,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42649:146"/> and riches, and wiſdome, and ſtrength, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Glory, and bleſſing, for ever, and ever.</hi> AMEN.</p>
